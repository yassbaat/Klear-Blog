Design Basics &amp; Overall Principles</h1><h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4niqpuj" class="font-bold">1-Mosque Fundamental Design Principles:</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I am not here to critique the mosque designs.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I am here to provide a perspective on how we can improve and implement design principles that can help elevate the experience of worshipers, make the environment more peaceful and calm and adhere to the principles of the prophet to avoid any kind of distraction when praying.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The principle that I want every Muslim to always have in mind, whether they are designing a mosque or just praying in it is: How can we improve the user experience in mosques for our fellow Muslims?</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Solving the issues that nobody talks about is almost always the highest value. Solving a UX challenge for users, while the current solution in place is good enough.</p><p>Almost anyone can solve issues when they are apparent, the real challenge is to feel the pain of something that is not easily seen. As an example, Everyone can pick up something when they see it has fallen because it's easy physical work, our job as designers is to prevent that thing from falling in the first place, the designer sees what most people don't even notice.<br><br>In the following sections, we will go into the details of these principles:<br>- Enhancing the spiritual experience: <br>- Provide a heightened spiritual experience, minimizing technology distractions inside the prayer hall which is one of the biggest issues of modern times to spirituality and focus.<br>- Minimizing physical distractions<br>-Balancing tradition with modern needs<br>-Making the essential frictionless, from wayfinding to finding all necessary amenities. Visiting the mosque should be an intuitive journey from the moment of Entering the mosque to leaving it.</p><p> </p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Let's start from the outside.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4niqpuk" class="font-bold">Mosque Signs:</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Every mosque should have a sign system. While people can ask each other and waste time looking for what they need, we could save so much time for worshipers by making a reliable, consistent sign system across all mosques in a city or country. That way we remove the guessing time and effort. I remember once praying in a city I've never been to (Rafraf), and the main mosque had an ablution area underground, I thought I was going to be early for the prayer but I kept looking for 5 minutes and couldn't figure out where it was, so I asked two people that gave me directions that weren't accurate because they assume that it is easy because they pray there every day. So I kept looking and I only eventually found it, when people started coming out after they have finished their Wudhu. I was late for the prayer.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpul">Designing Mosque Signs Guide:</h3><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">1- <strong>A sign of the mosque's name.</strong> There were times, that I didn't even notice that there is a mosque just because there was no sign.</p><p>Having signs helps the community facilitate having mosques as a geographical and spiritual reference.<br>Having signs with the mosque's name makes it easier for the community to use the mosque as a reference and meeting point. I.e there is a lecture in "Asala" mosque, or that shop is near that (insert mosque name) mosque. etc...</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">2-<strong> Overview of all amenities,</strong> this should be placed at the entry of the mosque. pointing out the directions of all the main a prayer hall in the first stair, ablution place, women's prayer hall etc...</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">3- Ablution sign, must be placed in the entry of the mosque, as well as near the main prayer hall, since most people can easily identify the prayer hall - because it's the main focus of the architecture.</p><p>4- <strong>The sign for the women prayer room should also be visible in the men's section.</strong><br>Usually, when a woman wants to pray in a mosque, the men go first looking and asking if there's a women's prayer hall. So even if the women's designated prayer area access is far from the men's, a sign should be present showing the direction of the women's prayer area.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">5- <strong>Provide any necessary information.</strong> Example, provide the phone number and name of responsible person for opening the door of the women's prayer hall, or the responsible for Tahfeeth.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpum" class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Free Signage Template:</h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center">I've designed this template to be printed on A4 papers. So that everyone can print them at home, and stick them in their local Mosque. However, you can modify the dimensions to your liking.<br><br><img src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/Artboard-1-copy-2.png" alt="" width="433" height="561" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-xs.png 320w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-sm.png 480w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-md.png 768w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-xl.png 1024w"></figure><br><br><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/Artboard-1-copy-13.png" alt="" width="480" height="371" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-13-xs.png 320w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-13-sm.png 480w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-13-md.png 768w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-13-xl.png 1024w"></figure><br><strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zoQ1hmpPRc86vyaHQLtF8l46YxEVRg5t/view?usp=sharing" title="Free Mosque Signage Design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">📂🗃️Download Illustrator File</a></strong><p></p><h1 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpun" class="font-bold">II- Increasing Khushu' (Reverence) in The Prayer Hall:</h1><h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpuo" class="font-bold">1- Lights:</h2><p>a- Having natural light inside the prayer hall is crucial. I don't prefer it when I go to some mosques at Thu'hr or Asr and find the lights turned on. I feel that I am at an office. Prayer should make one feel relaxed and having lights turned on at that time somewhat makes me tense. <br><br></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-xs.jpg 320w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-sm.jpg 480w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-md.jpg 768w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-xl.jpg 1024w"><figcaption>A great example of  natural lighting</figcaption></figure><h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpup">Windows:</h3><p>Ceiling Windows " clerestory windows" are ideal for letting natural light in. They also create a beautiful, diffused light that can enhance the spiritual atmosphere.<br>Normal windows should be at a minimum of 1.25 meter above the ground (adjust according to mosque's environment).<br>Avoid Windows facing the Qibla to avoid distracting worshippers. If the parts that allow natural light are facing the Qibla, they should not be transparent, use Non-transparent materials like frosted glass or translucent panels. Or ideally they should be 2m+ above the ground. With a mechanism that allows for easy opening and closing for ventilation.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Lights should always, always, always be warm, please. Never have fluorescent bulbs. Night prayers are close to people's bedtimes, and having white light will not only disrupt some people's sleep but is not calming! 4500K+ .</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Lights should be on the dim side. This instantly creates an atmosphere where people become calm. I noticed that some people start chatting and talking about worldly matters inside the mosque when they feel that they are in a social setting because of the intensity of the light.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">According to research, dim lighting can reduce stress hormones and increase melatonin, promoting a more relaxed atmosphere. Although dim lighting is great, always make sure to allow for adequate lighting for reading, aiming for 150 lux.</p><p>I also suggest having an option to increase the light to boost attentiveness during Friday prayers and lectures.<br><br><br></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpuq" class="font-bold">2-Colors:</h3><p>Avoid bright colors, especially inside the prayer hall. Colors should be neutral and do not distract the worshipers. That includes:<br>1-The carpets, especially the carpets! That's what the worshiper looks at when praying. There is a hadith in Bukhari and Muslim:</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed in a black cloak that had markings, and he looked at its markings. When he finished praying, he said: "Take this cloak to Abu Jahm ibn Hudhayfah, and bring me his plain garment, for they distracted me just now when I was praying." Hishaam ibn 'Urwah narrated from his father, from 'Aa'ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "I was looking at its markings whilst I was praying and I was afraid that they would distract me."</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The black cloak referred to (Khameesah) is a striped cloak made of silk or wool. The plain cloak referred to is a heavy cloak with no decoration on it.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">-The walls shouldn't be unnecessarily decorated with colorful tiles or such.</p><ul class="-mt-1 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8"><li class="whitespace-normal break-words">The Mihrab - It's the central piece of the mosque, and should not have distractions for the imam. Why do you need to have expensive decorations? Is this from the Deen? Why are you inventing?</li><li class="whitespace-normal break-words">I would say, that I have one exception that can be accepted, which is using high-quality materials. Such as marble, high quality wood or even high quality carpets (only not decorated ones as we discussed earlier) and that is to reduce the cost of long-term maintenance. So always use high-quality materials if possible.</li></ul><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">-The light fixtures/ chandeliers: Although these usually don't distract worshippers during prayer, as they are not in the field of view, chandeliers are expensive and do not usually make for an improvement of light quality.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">-I suggest having spots pointing towards the Minbar and lecture desk, highlighting the Imam/Lecturer.</p><ul class="-mt-1 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8"><li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Although useful, I am actually against having a TV at the front of the prayer hall that displays the prayer times and events of the mosque. It makes it the center of attention, which obviously shouldn't be. I argue that the TV should be placed either outside the prayer hall in the patio, or at the back where it is not facing any worshippers that way you can see how much time is remaining for the Iqamah, events on the way out, and that's where you can engage in conversation such as planning to attend the lecture or when is the next prayer or the usual Iqamah times of the mosque. I argue that you shouldn't be waiting to get up to pray by the second, prayer should be a calm and stress free environment.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpur" class="font-bold">3-Furniture:</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">It is ideal to have custom made furniture. Such as seats, tables, desks, shoe racks and shelves. Making everything blend together, doing this not only provides the mosque with better quality longer lasting items, but also improves the experience, reduces the variation in color and makes everything consistent. Avoid plastic chairs, as those are usually known to break quickly making it unsafe for old people and sick people who cannot perform Sujud.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpus" class="font-bold">4- Accessibility of Quran copies:</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Here are the criteria of where Quran copies should be placed: a- Should be placed in Open shelves b- Should be accessible yet high enough for all ages above 10 YO. c- Should never be placed in closed drawers and book lockers, that only increases friction for the readers and some people might not want to draw attention for themselves opening and closing the lockers especially if they are not familiar with the mosque, plus they take a big space and require more maintenance. So a big no for having book lockers.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirput" class="font-bold"> The number of Quran copies placed in the hall of prayer.</h3><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I think there is an exaggeration for the number of copies placed. Not to discourage anyone from buying copies of the Quran and placing them in the mosques! NO that's not the point! I eagerly want to push my brothers and sisters to do so, but, instead of placing a 150 copies in a prayer hall that has at maximum 100 people, why not make a study and figure out the optimal number +some margin. And the rest can be placed in other mosques, or gifted to people who need a copy.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I would say that the study should be done in 2 times, Jumuah prayers and Ramadan. That should cover the highest periods of reading for the Quran.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpuu" class="font-bold">5- Acoustics</h2><p>Acoustics (no need for microphones if the surface of the mosque is small, provides a better experience, only microphone auxiliary if the imam does have a high voice.)<br>- Make sure that the women's prayer area and/or other floors can hear the Imam in case the electricity goes off.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpuv" class="font-bold">6- Women's Prayer Area</h2><p>If on the same level, one way tinted mirror separation, is optimal, so that allows women in their prayer area to see into the men’s prayer hall without being seen themselves. <br><br>This setup provides privacy for women while keeping them engaged and informed during prayers. Sujud tilawa, imam mistake, the gestures and body language of the imam at Jumuah Prayer etc...<br>The reflection of the mirror also makes the space in the men's prayer area feel bigger.</p><h1 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv0" class="font-bold">III- Amenities:</h1><h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv1" class="font-bold">Accessibility:</h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center">We all know how unpleasant shoes on the floor are. Not only they are not pleasant to look at and create chaos, it also creates an accessibility issue.<br><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/_468b4930-f83c-4863-962f-9d33bfea8d4f.jfif" alt="" width="354" height="354"></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center">One of the most effective ways I've seen to combat this is having a "shoe-free" zone sticker at the entrance and access points of the prayer hall.<br><img loading="lazy" src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/_448c5795-3bc0-4ee1-9595-785562bb6626.jfif" alt="" width="507" height="507"></figure><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Shoe racks shouldn't be too far from the pathway to the entrance of the prayer hall, failing to do so will encourage people to just drop their shoes in the nearest and most convenient place, which is the floor. (Even when there are enough shoe racks).</p><ul class="-mt-1 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8"><li class="whitespace-normal break-words">If there are any steps in the entrance, having ramps and handrails in the access of the mosque is mandatory, I can't count the number of mosques I've been to that forget this simple detail.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv3" class="font-bold">Re-defining ablution areas:</h2><ol class="-mt-1 list-decimal space-y-2 pl-8"><li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Toilets should be outside the premises: In historic mosques you couldn't find toilets inside the premises of the mosque, only ablution areas, because there was no sewage system. I argue that this should be the same in our time.</li></ol><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Baz and the members of the committee appear to favor prohibition. It is mentioned in the fatwas of the Permanent Committee:</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The restroom must be separated so that it is outside the mosque, and there should be a wall between it and the mosque.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Ablution areas can be inside the mosque: فأباح ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما الوضوء من زمزم وهي في المسجد الحرام ونهى عن الاغتسال منها تنزيهاً للمسجد من التعري والاغتسال فيه من الجنابة</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Toilets and ablution areas must be separate, ideally, we can place an ablution area inside and outside (near to the toilets but separated of) the mosque.</p><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Having ablution areas separate from the toilets makes walking barefoot allowed to avoid "Najasa". The prayer area and ablution area should be connected with a slip-resistance material, Which is far better than having flip-flops which are limited in number and may cause skin irritations. Also, this allows for feet to dry, keeping carpets clean and avoid getting them wet which makes them smell bad. And reduce the reliance of having paper towel to dry.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv4" class="font-bold">New Concept: Showers in Ablution Areas:</h3><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Since toilets are not inside the mosque they should include at least one shower, so that travelers that don't have a place to stay (or homeless people) can shower from Janabah or to clean themselves before entering the mosque. These showers should have a waterproof closet to put all of one's belongings. The number of showers should not be excessive, even in big mosques, so that the mosque does not become a destination for people to take showers. Just enough to serve the purpose.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv5" class="font-bold">Practical standard: estimate the number of faucets needed.</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Ablution Estimation</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Average Ablution Time</strong>: 2 minutes.</li><li><strong>Average Iqamah Time</strong>: 10 minutes (adjust based on your mosque's timings).</li><li><strong>People Needing Wudu</strong>:<ul><li>15% in residential areas.</li><li>Up to 40% in commercial and non-residential areas.</li><li>Use 25% for mixed areas.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Formula</strong>:</p><pre class="language-matlab"><code>Number of Toilets Required= ((Maximum Number of Worshippers)×(Wudu Percentage/100)×(AIT+Allowance) )/ ( AAT×CC )
