Adhering to the principles of the prophet to avoid any kind of distraction when praying.</p><p>The principle that I want every muslim to always have in mind, wether they are designing a mosque or just praying in it is:<br><strong>How can we improve the user experience in mosques for our fellow Muslims?<br></strong><br>Solving the issues that nobody talks about is almost always the highest value.<br>Solving a UX challenge for users, while the current solution in place is good enough. <br><br>Almost anyone can solve issues when they are apparent, the real challenge is to feel the pain of something that is not easily seen. Everyone can pick up something when they see it has fallen because it's easy physical work, our job as designers is to prevent that thing from falling in the first place, the designer sees what most people don't even notice.</p><p>We will discuss many of these non-apparant issues, but just as an appetizer here's an example:<br>Every mosque should have a signs system, while people can ask each other and waste time looking for what they need. we could save so much time for worshipers by making a reliable, consistent sign system accross all mosques in a city or country. That way we remove the guessing time and effort. I remember once praying in a city I've never been to (Rafraf), and the main mosque has the abolution area underground, I thought I was going to be early for the prayer but I kept looking for 5 minutes and couldn't figure where it was, so I asked two people that gave me directions that weren't accurate, because they assume that it is easy because they pray there everyday. so I kept looking and eventually when people started coming and performing Wudhu at that moment I saw where </p><h3><br>Designing Mosque Signs Guide:</h3><p>1- A sign of the mosque name. There were times, that I didn't even notice that there is a mosque just because there were no sign. Having signs with the mosque name makes it easier for the community to use the mosque as a reference and meeting point. I.e there is a lecture in "Asala" mosque, or that shop is near that mosque. etc... <br>it helps the community facilitate having mosques as a geographical and spiritual reference.</p><p>2- Overview all amenities, this should be placed at the entry of the mosque. If there is a prayer hall in the first stair, abulution place, women prayer hall</p><p>2- Abulution sign, must placed in the entry of the mosque, as well as near the main prayer hall, since most people can easily identify the prayer hall - because it's the main focus of the architecture.<br><br>The sign for the women prayer room should also be visible in the men’s  section. Because usually, when a woman wants to pray, the men go first looking and asking if there’s a women’s prayer hall. so even if the women’s designated prayer area is far form the men’s , a sign should be present showing the direction of the women’s prayer area.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5- The placement of Quran copies. <br>Here are the criteria of where Quran copies should be placed:<br>a- Should be placed in Open shelves<br>b- Should be accessible yet high enough for all ages above 10 YO.<br>c- Should never be placed in closed drawers and book lockers, that only increases friction for the readers and some people might not want to draw attention for themselves opening and closing the lockers especially if they are not familiar with the mosque, plus they take a big space and require more maintenance. So a big no for having book lockers.<br><br><br></p><p>6- The number of Quran copies places in the hall of prayer. <br>I think there is an exaggeration for the number of copies placed. Not to discourage anyone from buying copies of the Quran and placing them in the mosques! NO that's not the point! <br>I eagerly want to push my brothers and sisters to do so, but, instead of placing a 150 copies in a prayer hall that has at maximum 100 people, why not make a study and figure out the optimal number +some margin. And the rest can be placed in other mosques, or gifted to people who need a copy.</p><p>I would say that the study should be done in 2 times, Jumuah prayers and Ramadan. That should cover the highest periods of reading for the Quran. </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Chapter 2: <br>Increasing خشوع :<br><br></h2><h4>1- Lights:</h4><p>a- Having natural light inside the prayer hall is crucial. I don't prefer it when I go to some mosques at Thu'hr or Asr and find the lights turned on. I feel that I am at an office. Prayer should make one feel relaxed and having lights turned on at that time somewhat makes me tense. Yet not too much natural light, </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-xs.jpg 320w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-sm.jpg 480w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-md.jpg 768w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-xl.jpg 1024w"><figcaption>A great example of  natural lighting</figcaption></figure><p><br><br>b- Lights should always, always, always be warm please. Never have fluorescent bulbs please. Night prayers are close to people's bedtimes, and having white light will not only disrupt some people's sleep but is not calming! 4500K + <br>c- lights should be on the dim side. that instanly creates an atmosphere where people become calm. I noticed that some people start chatting and talking about worldly matters inside the mosque when they feel that they are in a social setting because of the intensity of the light.</p><h5>Colors:</h5><p>Avoid bright colors, especially inside the prayer hall. Colors should be neutral and do not distract the worshipers. <br>that includes: <br>1-The carpets, especially the carpets! That's where the worshiper looks at when praying.<br>There is a hadith in Bukhari and Muslim:</p><p>" the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed in a black cloak that had markings, and he looked at its markings. When he finished praying, he said: “Take this cloak to Abu Jahm ibn Hudhayfah, and bring me his plain garment, for they distracted me just now when I was praying.”. Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah narrated from his father, from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I was looking at its markings whilst I was praying and I was afraid that they would distract me.” </p><p>The black cloak referred to (Khameesah) is a striped cloak made of silk or wool. <br>The plain cloak referred to is a heavy cloak with no decoration on it. </p><p>-The walls. <br>- The Mihrab - It's the central piece of the mosque, and should not have distractions for the imam. Why do you need to have expensive deccorations? is this from the Deen? Why are you inventing? <br>- I would say, that I have one exception that can be accepted, which is using high-quality materials. Such as marble, high quality wood or even high quality carpets ( only not decorated ones as we discussed earlier) and that is to reduce the cost of long-term maintenance. So always use high-quality materials if possible.<br><br><br>-The light fixtures/ chandeliers <br>-</p><p>_______________________________________________________________<br>To be continued.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2024-04-04T18:32">Apr 4, 2024</time></div><div class="post__share"></div></footer></div></article></main><div class="right-bar"><div class="right-bar__inner"><div class="sidebar"><section class="box tags"><h3 class="box__title">Recommended Topics</h3><ul class="tags__list"><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/tags/design/" class="btn btn--gray">Design <sup>(2)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/tags/islam/" class="btn btn--gray">Islam <sup>(2)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/tags/learning/" class="btn btn--gray">Learning <sup>(2)</sup></a></li></ul></section></div></div></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://klear.pages.dev/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
