Decisions will still be made by humans. Here’s why:</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans are the gatekeepers to the digital world, because they are the gatekeepers to the physical world, meaning that if AI starts doing things that are dangerous or harming for humans, we can simply just “pull the plug out” as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Schmidt the Ex-Google CEO always says in his interviews about AI.</span></li><li data-sourcepos="6:1-6:333">Imagine if AI was a very smart person that you agree with, say your business partner, your brother, or a very close friend that you really trust in terms of decision making and as a person. You still wouldn't hand them the keys to your life to make even the smallest decisions, because you still want to have a saying in your life.</li><li data-sourcepos="7:1-7:460">Even when your decisions might not be the most logical or analytical, you must understand that humans are complex emotional beings. We are emotional by default. We just use data and logic to justify our emotions. That doesn't make taking emotional decisions good or bad; it just makes them unpredictable. And also that doesn't mean that AI won't be able to understand emotions, however it is super difficult to predict when predicting that becomes a reality.</li><li data-sourcepos="8:1-8:161">It is mandatory for every business to look at what they do on a daily basis and decide if this can be done by an AI agent and work on removing the bottlenecks.</li><li data-sourcepos="9:1-9:180">In a way, companies will be creating agents for their particular needs. It will become their moat, the same way that a small retail shop can exist in an age of e-commerce giants.</li><li data-sourcepos="10:1-10:424">Another important idea is that this artificial intelligence agent revolution can be completely silent. Companies that create these successful agents that are capable of mimicking doing human tasks will go unnoticed, and these companies won't share that. They are using agents to keep their competitive advantage. It's like having a trade secret or a very brilliant employee that you don't want competitors to get ahead of.</li><li data-sourcepos="11:1-11:250">Create a way for AI agents and human employees to communicate. For example, employees may still fill out forms to keep things quick and just make a picture of the filled form that AI agents can analyze and take decisions – a human retail assistant.</li><li data-sourcepos="12:1-12:639">A super optimized Retail Assistant that should stay relevant even with the presence of AGI. It's about streamlining the communication between the real world and AI. It's not just about the IQ and intelligence level of the models. In fact, I would argue that smarter models are not the answer to creating more useful AI solutions. The present models are in fact very capable of decision making and understanding the needs of the users. What's missing is just the correct framework of collaboration between the human and AI. Smarter models could in fact help but not necessary. Use the current models and always keep the human in the loop.</li><li data-sourcepos="13:1-13:483">Even if the AI models will get super advanced, there will still be a need to interact efficiently with the models. Text might not be the best and fastest way to get ideas across. Interfaces should still be relevant in an age of "AGI" or very capable models. It's how quickly you can remove redundancy and repetitiveness. Think about it, would you like to always keep repeating yourself to achieve a small task or have an interface that you can refer back to to get the same result?</li><li data-sourcepos="14:1-15:0">A good idea is to create a dashboard to interact with one's agents, and customize each interface of communication with each agent to be more efficient. Always through the lens of "Human-Led AI Agents."</li></ul><h3 data-sourcepos="16:1-16:46">The correct way to think about AI and what to do about it.</h3><ul data-sourcepos="18:1-36:120"><li data-sourcepos="18:1-18:119">Do not project yourself to infinity. You cannot know the future and you are not certain, and the world isn't certain.</li><li data-sourcepos="19:1-19:169">The biggest AI shift will be when AI can deploy physical assets and verify these assets using humans. Eventually AI will be able to own stuff, assets, and communicate.</li><li data-sourcepos="20:1-24:48">Focus 100% on:<ul data-sourcepos="21:5-24:48"><li data-sourcepos="21:5-21:80">AI agents are the future and the present. Learn to use and make AI agents.</li><li data-sourcepos="22:5-22:53">Connect Retail/Physical world to AI to win big.</li><li data-sourcepos="23:5-23:44">Put in the work in the physical world.</li><li data-sourcepos="24:5-24:48">Conventional SaaS would be dead. Hyper-optimized Agentic Saas is the future.</li></ul></li><li data-sourcepos="25:1-25:39">AI will not drive people out of work.</li><li data-sourcepos="26:1-26:92">Decision making (this must be done as humans have leverage and are the gatekeepers to AI).</li><li data-sourcepos="27:1-27:301">Physical work: this is a bit far in terms of execution, especially in third-world countries. Even in rich countries, this will take a lot of capital, time, and effort. People with huge capital will be able to automate a lot of tasks, medium to low class won't be able to get access to this at scale.</li><li data-sourcepos="28:1-28:132">Reasoning: Humans will not be out of these jobs, but they will be amplified, making reasoning and creating a matter of initiative.</li><li data-sourcepos="29:1-29:301">You can easily create and train multiple things AI will help you achieve it, but are you willing to decide to work on that thing or not. You still have to interact with your human world to get value out of them. AI alone won't be able to decide what to work on unless a human gives it that capacity.</li><li data-sourcepos="30:1-30:92">The future belongs to the speed of execution. How well are you going to use the resources?</li><li data-sourcepos="31:1-31:141">Start working and incrementally improving today, stop fiddling around. The smartest AI will go to those who produce and build in the world.</li><li data-sourcepos="33:1-33:64">Stop worrying about AI taking your job, or replacing everyone. What will you be able to do starting from this moment?</li><li data-sourcepos="33:1-33:64">My super practical advice is Learn to use and make AI agents. This is a very important thing to do, and this is a highly effective and rewardful feat to achieve.</li><li data-sourcepos="34:1-34:199">Super intelligence where AI will deploy its own assets and use other AIs and even hire people is super complex and should take 20-100 years. You will still need to tell the AI the outcome you want. Only Allah knows if the world would still exist in this time frame.</li><li data-sourcepos="35:1-35:235">Big companies will create amazing agents. Small companies will create small agents for super specific tasks. Agents will be sold/hired. The best agents will be categorized according to power, complexity, outcomes, and price to value.</li><li data-sourcepos="36:1-36:120">In the end it will be about who owns power (electricity) and who builds the best models and agents and optimizes them.</li></ul></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2025-06-14T03:16">Jun 14, 2025</time></div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyasine.net%2Fthoughts-on-ai-and-what-to-do-to-stay-relevant%2F" class="js-share facebook tltp tltp--top" aria-label="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://yasine.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyasine.net%2Fthoughts-on-ai-and-what-to-do-to-stay-relevant%2F&amp;via=Yasine&amp;text=Is%20AI%20Replacing%20Us%20Thinkers%3F%20How%20I%20Solved%20This%20scary%20Question%20After%20Pausing%20Everything%20for%20a%20month!" class="js-share twitter tltp tltp--top" aria-label="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://yasine.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyasine.net%2Fthoughts-on-ai-and-what-to-do-to-stay-relevant%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fyasine.net%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F15%2FChatGPT-Image-Jun-14-2025-03_13_24-AM.png&amp;description=Is%20AI%20Replacing%20Us%20Thinkers%3F%20How%20I%20Solved%20This%20scary%20Question%20After%20Pausing%20Everything%20for%20a%20month!" class="js-share pinterest tltp tltp--top" aria-label="Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://yasine.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span></a></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__section post__related"><div class="main__inner"><h3 class="post__section__title">Related post</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__meta"><div class="c-card__author"><a href="https://yasine.net/authors/klear/">Yasine</a></div><time datetime="2024-02-28T11:55">Feb 28, 2024 </time><a href="https://yasine.net/tags/learning/" class="c-card-tag">Learning</a></div><header class="c-card__header"><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://yasine.net/what-i-do-why-should-you-read-this-blog/">What I do.
