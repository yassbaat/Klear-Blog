                <p>Don't read any other startup ideas guide, if you ever feel lost, just open this blog and you will find everything you need. <br><br><br>Here's a checklist for choosing the idea. Try to check most of these boxes, if you don't you might run into big problems:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>0- Avoid solving cool problems, vitamins. The bill spliting app, the habit tracker, the cool social app. Go for pain killers. No only that but also, avoid consumer products.<br><br>1- Ideas Must be B2B.<br>It has to solve Business problems, avoid customer problems like the plague! <br><strong><br>All successfull startups are B2B! with the exeption of games and arbitrage i.e retail) ( I would argue that even arbitrage ideas like amazon are only successful because they help business owners sell on their platform. ) <br>This advice also applies for standard brick and mortar Retail businesses. The ones that are successful if they allow other people to make money with them - through franchising.  </strong></p>
<p>people look at these the other way around because most people are consumers, they think google helps people find content, airbnb lists cool places to rent, and uber as a replacement for taxis for the masses<br>the correct way to look at it is: (business owners run ads so they need google, Tenants rent houses so they need a place to post , drivers find leads so there's uber) <br>So if you are not helping businesses you're in trouble almost all of the time.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Pick something that has a big demand, and low supply ( of companies and people that want to work on ) </p>
<p>- Pick an idea that solves valuable problems and companies are willing to pay for. Don't pick cheap problems. Competition can be a good indicator of things that people are paying for. However tough competition is for losers. Never go for the easiest low-hanging fruits if you don't want to become a slave for the business. At least pick something with a high barrier to entry. For example, there are fewer people designing full apps than social media banners. There's a higher barrier to entry and knowledge pre-requisites. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Solving more valuable problems, bigger problems can be easier:<br>a-  Customers want to sign up because they need that pain to be solved.<br>b- you get more press attention.<br>c-Smart people want to join, fund and work at your startup.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Solve your own problem, you have to be your first customer, or at least you have to know someone that wants to use your product. If you woudn't want to use your product who will??</p>
<p>- Target a niche at the beginning, world domination later. Always start with a sub-set you can target and dominate quickly then expand. Facebook-standanford, airbnb -NYC , Amazon-books.<br>- In a way, this is a technique of marketing, just a very good one.  it's a very high converting technique, because you have a higher chance at making these people trust you and listen to you. as opposed to some random ad that they have seen the first itme in their live on a random webiste. <br>you have to have a marketing plan in place, how are you going to target these people?<br>In a way, billboards, TV, and advertising through sponsoring Youtube channels or very well known blogs ( such as doing interviews or having your own following) is very effective because it gives you authority, and people belive that you have money and that you can help them.</p>
<p><br><br><br><br><br><br>The last step to Choosing the idea. You have to have a certain conviction of your ideas.<br>If you stick to all the criteria above, your idea should work إن شاء الله .<br>But even if you have the best idea, you will get nowhere if you ditch it and pivot every few months. you will get nowhere guaranteed. So please. Stick to one idea, choose something that you find interesting. Then find a way to motivate yourself to keep working on it. </p>
<p>You should work on one thing. Using one stack that you become professional at. Reduce changing the variables, especially completely changing the project.<br><br><br><br>----<br>Having a routine will make you look superhuman, doing the same thing over and over will make your returns exponatial, because people will look at your achivements and try to compare your results after doing the same thing for years to themselves when they are starting or trying to do it for the first time! Never fall for this trap!<br>When I started training kicboxing, I thought that other people are stronger, tolarate  <br><br><br><br><br><br>-----<br>Retail Ideas - <br>retails ideas are different beast. If you have a physical or a retail business.</p>

                <h1>بسم الله</h1>
<p>Chapters:<br>1- Design Basics &amp; overall principles<br>2- </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Design Basics &amp; Principles:</h3>
<p>I am not here to critique the mosque designs.</p>
<p>I am here to provide a perspective on how we can improve and implement design principles that can help elevate the experience of worshipers, make the environment more peaceful and calm. Adhering to the principles of the prophet to avoid any kind of distraction when praying.</p>
<p>The principle that I want every muslim to always have in mind, wether they are designing a mosque or just praying in it is: <br><strong>How can we improve the user experience in mosques for our fellow Muslims?<br></strong><br>Solving the issues that nobody talks about is almost always the highest value.<br>Solving a UX challenge for users, while the current solution in place is good enough. <br><br>Almost anyone can solve issues when they are apparent, the real challenge is to feel the pain of something that is not easily seen. Everyone can pick up something when they see it has fallen because it's easy physical work, our job as designers is to prevent that thing from falling in the first place, the designer sees what most people don't even notice.</p>
<p>We will discuss many of these non-apparant issues, but just as an appetizer here's an example:<br>Every mosque should have a signs system, while people can ask each other and waste time looking for what they need. we could save so much time for worshipers by making a reliable, consistent sign system accross all mosques in a city or country. That way we remove the guessing time and effort. I remember once praying in a city I've never been to (Rafraf), and the main mosque has the abolution area underground, I thought I was going to be early for the prayer but I kept looking for 5 minutes and couldn't figure where it was, so I asked two people that gave me directions that weren't accurate, because they assume that it is easy because they pray there everyday. so I kept looking and eventually when people started coming and performing Wudhu at that moment I saw where </p>
<h3><br>Designing Mosque Signs Guide:</h3>
<p>1- A sign of the mosque name. There were times, that I didn't even notice that there is a mosque just because there were no sign. Having signs with the mosque name makes it easier for the community to use the mosque as a reference and meeting point. I.e there is a lecture in "Asala" mosque, or that shop is near that mosque. etc... <br>it helps the community facilitate having mosques as a geographical and spiritual reference.</p>
<p>2- Overview all amenities, this should be placed at the entry of the mosque. If there is a prayer hall in the first stair, abulution place, women prayer hall</p>
<p>2- Abulution sign, must placed in the entry of the mosque, as well as near the main prayer hall, since most people can easily identify the prayer hall - because it's the main focus of the architecture.<br><br>The sign for the women prayer room should also be visible in the men’s  section. Because usually, when a woman wants to pray, the men go first looking and asking if there’s a women’s prayer hall. so even if the women’s designated prayer area is far form the men’s , a sign should be present showing the direction of the women’s prayer area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>5- The placement of Quran copies. <br>Here are the criteria of where Quran copies should be placed:<br>a- Should be placed in Open shelves<br>b- Should be accessible yet high enough for all ages above 10 YO.<br>c- Should never be placed in closed drawers and book lockers, that only increases friction for the readers and some people might not want to draw attention for themselves opening and closing the lockers especially if they are not familiar with the mosque, plus they take a big space and require more maintenance. So a big no for having book lockers.<br><br><br></p>
<p>6- The number of Quran copies places in the hall of prayer. <br>I think there is an exaggeration for the number of copies placed. Not to discourage anyone from buying copies of the Quran and placing them in the mosques! NO that's not the point! <br>I eagerly want to push my brothers and sisters to do so, but, instead of placing a 150 copies in a prayer hall that has at maximum 100 people, why not make a study and figure out the optimal number +some margin. And the rest can be placed in other mosques, or gifted to people who need a copy.</p>
<p>I would say that the study should be done in 2 times, Jumuah prayers and Ramadan. That should cover the highest periods of reading for the Quran. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Chapter 2: <br>Increasing خشوع :<br><br></h2>
<h4>1- Lights:</h4>
<p>a- Having natural light inside the prayer hall is crucial. I don't prefer it when I go to some mosques at Thu'hr or Asr and find the lights turned on. I feel that I am at an office. Prayer should make one feel relaxed and having lights turned on at that time somewhat makes me tense. Yet not too much natural light, </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-xs.jpg 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-sm.jpg 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-md.jpg 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-xl.jpg 1024w"><figcaption>A great example of  natural lighting</figcaption></figure>
<p><br><br>b- Lights should always, always, always be warm please. Never have fluorescent bulbs please. Night prayers are close to people's bedtimes, and having white light will not only disrupt some people's sleep but is not calming! 4500K + <br>c- lights should be on the dim side. that instanly creates an atmosphere where people become calm. I noticed that some people start chatting and talking about worldly matters inside the mosque when they feel that they are in a social setting because of the intensity of the light.</p>
<h5>Colors:</h5>
<p>Avoid bright colors, especially inside the prayer hall. Colors should be neutral and do not distract the worshipers. <br>that includes: <br>1-The carpets, especially the carpets! That's where the worshiper looks at when praying.<br>There is a hadith in Bukhari and Muslim:</p>
<p>" the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed in a black cloak that had markings, and he looked at its markings. When he finished praying, he said: “Take this cloak to Abu Jahm ibn Hudhayfah, and bring me his plain garment, for they distracted me just now when I was praying.”. Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah narrated from his father, from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I was looking at its markings whilst I was praying and I was afraid that they would distract me.” </p>
<p>The black cloak referred to (Khameesah) is a striped cloak made of silk or wool. <br>The plain cloak referred to is a heavy cloak with no decoration on it. </p>
<p>-The walls. <br>- The Mihrab - It's the central piece of the mosque, and should not have distractions for the imam. Why do you need to have expensive deccorations? is this from the Deen? Why are you inventing? <br>- I would say, that I have one exception that can be accepted, which is using high-quality materials. Such as marble, high quality wood or even high quality carpets ( only not decorated ones as we discussed earlier) and that is to reduce the cost of long-term maintenance. So always use high-quality materials if possible.<br><br><br>-The light fixtures/ chandeliers <br>-</p>

                <p>Wonder-less is a Chrome extension that limits the tabs opened. <br>I noticed that once I get past a certain point when opening tabs, I become distracted, overwhelmed, and less focused.</p>
<p><strong>Wonder-less is the solution.</strong></p>

<figcaption ><strong>Onboarding screen.</strong></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now the user can have multiple options to increase the flexibility and not limit completely the user, avoiding getting frustrated with the app. While not completely limiting the user, the Chrome extension should always keep the user mindful of the number of tabs opened and show alerts once that number is reached.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//Settings.png" alt="" width="1262" height="1041" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//responsive/Settings-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//responsive/Settings-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//responsive/Settings-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//responsive/Settings-xl.png 1024w"></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>I have kept the maximum number of tabs that can be opened to 20. Because giving the user flexibility on that aspect defies the extension's purpose. <br>If for some reason, the user wants to go over that limit, they can deactivate the extension.</p>

<p>"Safhaa" is an Islamic feed for Chrome's new tab. the premise is simple.<br><br></p>
<p>The new tab will serve as a place to<strong> drag and drop</strong> and organize different <strong>"components"</strong>. <br>The new tab will become a place for you to improve your spirituality as well as productivity. <br>So there are two main parts to the app:<br><strong>1-Spiritual Features</strong><br><strong>2- Productivity Features</strong><br><br></p>
<p>In this version, we will start with these components:</p>
<h4>Islamic Features:</h4>
<h3><br>- The time and date:</h3>
<p>(both in Hijri and Georgian calendars)<br>Ability to switch the primary date format. Either display the hijri as a main calendar or the Georgian.</p>

<h3>- Prayer Times:</h3>
<p><br>When the prayer time is close ( less than 10 minutes away ), the indicator turns red to subtly bring attention to the user that they should start preparing themselves for prayer.</p>

<figcaption >the same concept is valid for the color system, if prayer time &lt; 10 minutes, the color pallete turns red.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3><br>-Wisdom.</h3>
<p><br>The user can view quotes from the Quran and Hadith. The user should scroll until the bar on the right becomes filled to view the next Ayah or Hadith.<br>In the next version, we can add a button that takes the user to (quran.com) so they can continue reading from there and read the explanation as well. More awesome illustrations will be added إن شاء الله.</p>

<p><br>- Reminders of the next important Islamic event <br><br>such as fasting specific dates (Achoura'a or Monday and Thursday) or a reminder of certain important dates such as the new Hijri year.</p>
<h3><br>- Show one of Allah's 99 Names.</h3>
<p>The purpose is to familiarize with them and to eventually memorize them and know their meaning. Clicking the element opens a link explaining the name in [ islamweb.com ] [ look for an article link for every name on Islamweb ]</p>

<p><br>-Quran radio:</p>
<p>I noticed that unless I want to hear or memorize a specific Surah of the Quran, I want to just click and start listening without having to spend time choosing what to listen to. sometimes giving up control is better. Just click on the start button and you start listening right away.</p>

<p>- Focus timer simpler Pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>I have always liked focused sprints. however, I find that I only use them to make me aware of the time I am spending, not to take a break. <br>Usually, when I use the Pomodoro technique, I just get distracted when the timer goes and "reminds me to take a break". <br>I work in 15-minute sprints, and that keeps me focused on the task at hand, if the timer goes off and I find myself distracted, I get back to the main thing. I take breaks when I feel like I need it, not systematically. we are not robots.<br><br></p>

                <p> </p>
<p>"The Maker's Contract" is inspired by "The Cult of Done Manifesto". I discovered this piece of writing not too long ago, and I feel that it is the best thing that I have read that resonates with someone who is a polymath like me. So here's my version of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are three states for a maker:<br><strong>1- Not knowing </strong><br><strong>2- Working on the project </strong><br><strong>3- Publishing/Launching it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1.png" alt="The stages of making" width="1920" height="1080" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-xl.png 1024w"></figure>
<p>If you do not know something, you should research it. If you have researched it for a few hours, then in theory, you should be knowledgeable about that subject more than someone who has never encountered it before. You can, in fact, share what you know with them; that counts in my book as knowing it. So you should move on to the action phase; you should work on that project without getting distracted by learning. Because learning snaps you out of the maker state. Researching more won't make your work perfect because: Everything is a draft.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<figure class="post__image"><strong>Accept that everything is a draft. </strong>It helps to get it done/published. <br>What is unseen counts for nothing. Would you rather ship work that can marginally help someone or never ship anything? Would you rather share what you have learned in those hours you have spent and give a shortcut to someone, or keep on learning without any fruits bearing?<br>Always go for sharing your draft; it's infinitely better than zero. Plus, your work will always be a draft; no one is ever 100% satisfied with their work at least if they keep learning.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1-copy.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xl.png 1024w"></figure>

<figure class="post__image"><strong>There is no editing stage:</strong> You will get used to no editing because you won't need editing. This is for advanced makers.<br>For beginner makers, try to restrict yourself from editing the small stuff. Just focus on getting the 80%+ right.<br>Editing kills your momentum.<br>Don't edit unless it’s something crucial and really affects the main objective of what you're making.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1-copy-2.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-xl.png 1024w"></figure>

<figure class="post__image">You won't know everything in advance. <strong>Making is the only way to learn.<br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-xl.png 1024w"></figure><br></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the first 15 minutes. What can I make in the following 15 minutes? Start there. Don't think about the end yet.<br><strong>Try to publish your work in the fewest number of 15-minute intervals possible.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/15mins-2.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-xl.png 1024w"></figure></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hate perfection. </strong>It's tedious and won't move the needle. It stops you from making and sharing stuff. Perfection is the enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a human, you are not perfect. If you want to be perfect, never do anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you fail, that counts as done.</strong> Only in this case, you can go back to the learning phase. And maybe you discover that this project isn't as fun or interesting as you thought. Even then, the advantage of failing is you won't say: "what if?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Have a place to publish your work.</strong> That way you know it is done. That way you stop your perfectionism and the countless unpublished work. <br><strong>Unpublished work = Unfinished work.</strong><br><strong> Published work = Made work.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/publish.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-xl.png 1024w"></figure></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To be a maker, you have to think differently. You cannot afford to wander around too much when executing your project. You have to have a certain can-do attitude. It's necessary to wonder; however, once you start making, you have to engage in what you do and stop learning.</p>
<figure class="post__image">There's a time for learning and there is a time for making. Once you have learned enough about the subject, you should execute. Granted, I am talking to people who already have experience and have been exploring different fields for a long time. But they are stuck either in the research phase or the perfectionist phase. I am not talking about someone who is just starting out.<br><br><strong>Go make something. now.</strong><br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Go-make-something-wallpaper.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-xl.png 1024w"></figure>

                <p>The column grid system is the key to consistent designs.💻</p>
<p>Before I have started using it, I felt that it was constraining and thought it was not worth it to use it. <br><br>However once I saw the dramatic improvements I always start my design process with it. <br><br>Whether it's a website, a mobile app or even a poster or minimalistic illustration (like the 'Minima' wallpaper set I'm working on which I am super excited about).  </p>
<p>The grid system gives structure to the design, it's more than making allignments easier, it makes the whole design consistent and gives appropriate breathing room for elements.</p>
