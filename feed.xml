                <p>Ever heard of this? <br>Money is complicated.<br>The financial system is so hard, only a few people understand it.<br>-<br>LIES.<br><br>Bankers and the federal reserve want you to beleive this.<br>As Adolf Hitler said:<br>The community does not exist on the fictious value of money but on the results of productive labor. which is what gives money its value.</p>

<p>We should focus on providing real value. Agriculture, industrial production should be the main focus. </p>
<p>3rd world countries have a huge problem which is that they try to emitate developed countries. If tourism works for them, it doesn't necessarly work for you. <br> <br>You only attract low quality tourists if you are not well developed as a country.<br><br><br>We should focus on the needs of our people.<br>The usury system "Riba" is the cancer that puts the money of the country in the hands of the few.<br><br>There was a reason why Geramny was the most prospourous country in the world in the 1930's while the US, USRR and the rest of european countries were strugguling with the great depressionon, they don't teach you that in the history books, don't they?<br><br>As Hitler did, we should oust the bankers that deal with usury.<br>We should put the capital at the service of the people. This is the core of the Islamic economic system. Never for the purpose of speculation. Only linked to real assets and values.<br><br><br>Taxes are absolutely unacceptable. Taxles should be organic, meaning, they should not be a sum that is taken at the end of the transactions. They should be justified, just like sales, for example:<br>- There should be no tax on vehicle circualtion, the government should sell gasoline for a profit in a way that covers the building , the expansion and the maintenance of roads.<br><br><br><br>Roadmap:<br>- Remove dealing with Usury. <br>Loans should be given out at zero percent intrest. The goverment this way stimulates the economy, <br>- Remove all forms of taxes on local people. <br>- Prices should be stabilized at all cost, inflation is a hoax. Inflation is the result of the banking system, which pushes speculation and flactuation to serve the purpose of the elite. while everyone else suffers.<br>While it is difficult for prices to stay the same especially for imported goods. The government should work on stabilzing what it could produce locally. Especially food related items. One would say that all prices are linked, so people working in the food industry would struggle to buy imported items and that nonbody will want to work in that field. Wrong. Since local people would have 0% tax, that alone should motivate them to work in these sectors. The government would then use the tax collected on foreign companies to hedge the inflation and the price increases of imported goods.<br>- Focus on producing all the necessary goods for your people. This would make your state truly independent. <br><br></p>
<h4>Your un-employed people are your best asset. </h4>
<p>un-employed people should be forced to pick sectors to work in, that could be using the mandatory military service. Either in Agriculture or Industry mega projects or any productive field of activity.<br>Hunders of thousands of un-employed people would be turned into a huge asset.<br>With the adequate practical training these people could turn into a skilled workforce. </p>

                <p><strong>Don't read any other startup ideas guide, if you ever feel lost, just open this blog and you will find everything you need. </strong><br><br><br><strong>Here's a checklist</strong> for choosing the idea. <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Try to check most of these boxes, if you don't you might run into big problems:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>0- Avoid solving cool problems - vitamins.<br>The bill spliting app, the habit tracker, the millionth cool social app. Go for pain killers. Not only that but also, avoid consumer products. Go where the money is, where the money is spent, solve problems that potentially can make money for other people (businesses)<br><br>1- Ideas Must be B2B.<br>It has to solve business problems - avoid customer problems like the plague! <br><strong><br>All successful startups are B2B! <br>with the exception of games and arbitrage i.e retail) ( I would argue that even arbitrage ideas like Amazon are only successful because they help business owners sell on their platform. ) <br>This advice also applies to standard brick and mortar Retail businesses. The ones that are successful if they allow other people to make money with them - through franchising.  </strong></p>
<p>People look at these the other way around because most people are consumers, they think Google helps people find content, Airbnb lists cool places to rent, and Uber as a replacement for taxis for the masses<br>the correct way to look at it is: (business owners run ads so they need Google, Tenants rent houses so they need a place to post, drivers find leads so there's Uber) <br>So if you are not helping businesses you're in trouble almost all of the time.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Ideally, Pick something that has a big demand, and low supply ( of companies and people that want to work on it) <br>-The second best thing to do is to copy something that's working and make a relevant twist on it (big or small).</p>
<p>- Pick an idea that solves valuable problems and companies are willing to pay for. Don't pick cheap problems. Competition can be a good indicator of things that people are paying for. However tough competition is for losers. Never go for the easiest low-hanging fruits if you don't want to become a slave for the business. At least pick something with a high barrier to entry. For example, there are fewer people designing full apps than social media banners. There's a higher barrier to entry and knowledge prerequisites. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Solving more valuable problems, bigger problems can be easier:<br>a-  Customers want to sign up because they need that pain to be solved.<br>b- you get more press attention.<br>c-Smart people want to join, fund, and work at your startup.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Solve your own problem, you have to be your first customer, or at least you have to know someone who wants to use your product. If you wouldn't want to use your product who will??</p>
<p>- Target a niche at the beginning, world domination later. Always start with a sub-set you can target and dominate quickly then expand. Facebook-standanford, Airbnb -NYC , Amazon-books.<br>- In a way, this is a technique of marketing, just a very good one.  it's a very high-converting technique. You have a higher chance of making these people trust you and listen to you. as opposed to some random ad that they have seen the first time in their life on a random website. <br>You have to have a marketing plan in place, how are you going to target these people?<br>In a way, billboards, TV, and advertising through sponsoring Youtube channels or very well-known blogs ( such as doing interviews or having your own following) is very effective because it gives you authority, and people believe that you have money and that you can help them.</p>
<p>- Another variation of this is selling in Marketplaces of established companies. Think B2B always. Shopify, Stripe etc... These have potential customers with a lot of money and you gain the trust of the platform as you are not a no-name website that can be fraudulent. Solve problems, make improvements to the platform and you have a good chance to get customers.<br><br><br>- Choose one idea, one stack, one feature to ship ( the most important feature ). If the idea is complex, then ship an MFP ( minimum functional Product).<br>Run super-targeted ads to the landing page, if you are solving a pain point, you should be able to get users.<br><br><br><br><br>The last step to Choosing the idea. You have to have a certain conviction of your ideas.<br>If you stick to all the criteria above, your idea should work إن شاء الله .<br>But even if you have the best idea, you will get nowhere if you ditch it and pivot every few months. you will get nowhere guaranteed. So please. Stick to one idea, choose something that you find interesting. Then find a way to motivate yourself to keep working on it. </p>
<p>You should work on one thing. Using one stack that you become professional at. Reduce changing the variables, especially completely changing the project.<br>Remember, serial tasking not multi-tasking. Work on one project at a time. You will never get anywhere if you have more than one destination. For the projects that don't work, stop them and choose one. Never dabble shallowly between tasks, you get paid for intensity and solving a problem well.<br><br><br><br>A small word about pricing:<br>If you want to have a competitive startup even in competitive niches. Offer more free features. Don't charge them anything and don't offer free trials. When they get used to using your software, you strike and you strike hard. without showing generic paywalls or annoying them, blurring the feature that they want to use. An amazing example of this is Crisp, they let you use all the features, but then if you exceed a certain amount of messages, and become a power user, they blurr out the chat history, with XXXX so that it makes it super frustrating for the user as they probably remember those conversations and feel the need to stay connected or go back and see what where the questions of those users.<br>Another amazing example of this is Pieter Level's Make book. He lets you read the first few chapters for free, and then, boom, as you become hooked to the book, some of the words become confuscated, however, you can continue to read and get the gist of the meaning. until you don't. You become frustrated, trying to decrypt it or find a way to unlock it and you can't so you don't have anything but buying the book.<br><br><br><br><br>----<br>Having a routine will make you look superhuman, doing the same thing over and over will make your returns exponential, because people will look at your achievements and try to compare your results after doing the same thing for years to themselves when they are starting or trying to do it for the first time! Never fall for this trap!<br>When I started training kicboxing, I thought that other people were stronger, tolarate more pain. There's an exercise where we kick a tire, to condition our chin. It really hurts. And I was surprised how painful it is the first time I kicked it, and here was some people kicking it so hard I thought I was super soft and weak. However, I kept doing it and gradually, within a month or two, I was one of the hardest kickers in the gym.<br><br><br><br><br><br>-----<br>Retail Ideas - <br>Retail ideas are a different beast. I will write a guide on retail businesses.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4niqpuj" class="font-bold">1-Mosque Fundamental Design Principles:</h2>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I am not here to critique the mosque designs.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I am here to provide a perspective on how we can improve and implement design principles that can help elevate the experience of worshipers, make the environment more peaceful and calm and adhere to the principles of the prophet to avoid any kind of distraction when praying.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The principle that I want every Muslim to always have in mind, whether they are designing a mosque or just praying in it is: How can we improve the user experience in mosques for our fellow Muslims?</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Solving the issues that nobody talks about is almost always the highest value. Solving a UX challenge for users, while the current solution in place is good enough.</p>
<p>Almost anyone can solve issues when they are apparent, the real challenge is to feel the pain of something that is not easily seen. As an example, Everyone can pick up something when they see it has fallen because it's easy physical work, our job as designers is to prevent that thing from falling in the first place, the designer sees what most people don't even notice.<br><br>In the following sections, we will go into the details of these principles:<br>- Enhancing the spiritual experience: <br>- Provide a heightened spiritual experience, minimizing technology distractions inside the prayer hall which is one of the biggest issues of modern times to spirituality and focus.<br>- Minimizing physical distractions<br>-Balancing tradition with modern needs<br>-Making the essential frictionless, from wayfinding to finding all necessary amenities. Visiting the mosque should be an intuitive journey from the moment of Entering the mosque to leaving it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Let's start from the outside.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4niqpuk" class="font-bold">Mosque Signs:</h2>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Every mosque should have a sign system. While people can ask each other and waste time looking for what they need, we could save so much time for worshipers by making a reliable, consistent sign system across all mosques in a city or country. That way we remove the guessing time and effort. I remember once praying in a city I've never been to (Rafraf), and the main mosque had an ablution area underground, I thought I was going to be early for the prayer but I kept looking for 5 minutes and couldn't figure out where it was, so I asked two people that gave me directions that weren't accurate because they assume that it is easy because they pray there every day. So I kept looking and I only eventually found it, when people started coming out after they have finished their Wudhu. I was late for the prayer.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpul">Designing Mosque Signs Guide:</h3>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">1- <strong>A sign of the mosque's name.</strong> There were times, that I didn't even notice that there is a mosque just because there was no sign.</p>
<p>Having signs helps the community facilitate having mosques as a geographical and spiritual reference. <br>Having signs with the mosque's name makes it easier for the community to use the mosque as a reference and meeting point. I.e there is a lecture in "Asala" mosque, or that shop is near that (insert mosque name) mosque. etc...</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">2-<strong> Overview of all amenities,</strong> this should be placed at the entry of the mosque. pointing out the directions of all the main a prayer hall in the first stair, ablution place, women's prayer hall etc...</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">3- Ablution sign, must be placed in the entry of the mosque, as well as near the main prayer hall, since most people can easily identify the prayer hall - because it's the main focus of the architecture.</p>
<p>4- <strong>The sign for the women prayer room should also be visible in the men's section.</strong> <br>Usually, when a woman wants to pray in a mosque, the men go first looking and asking if there's a women's prayer hall. So even if the women's designated prayer area access is far from the men's, a sign should be present showing the direction of the women's prayer area.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">5- <strong>Provide any necessary information.</strong> Example, provide the phone number and name of responsible person for opening the door of the women's prayer hall, or the responsible for Tahfeeth.</p>

<h1 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpun" class="font-bold">II- Increasing Khushu' (Reverence) in The Prayer Hall:</h1>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpuo" class="font-bold">1- Lights:</h2>
<p>a- Having natural light inside the prayer hall is crucial. I don't prefer it when I go to some mosques at Thu'hr or Asr and find the lights turned on. I feel that I am at an office. Prayer should make one feel relaxed and having lights turned on at that time somewhat makes me tense. <br><br></p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpup">Windows:</h3>
<p>Ceiling Windows " clerestory windows" are ideal for letting natural light in. They also create a beautiful, diffused light that can enhance the spiritual atmosphere.<br>Normal windows should be at a minimum of 1.25 meter above the ground (adjust according to mosque's environment).<br>Avoid Windows facing the Qibla to avoid distracting worshippers. If the parts that allow natural light are facing the Qibla, they should not be transparent, use Non-transparent materials like frosted glass or translucent panels. Or ideally they should be 2m+ above the ground. With a mechanism that allows for easy opening and closing for ventilation.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Lights should always, always, always be warm, please. Never have fluorescent bulbs. Night prayers are close to people's bedtimes, and having white light will not only disrupt some people's sleep but is not calming! 4500K+ .</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Lights should be on the dim side. This instantly creates an atmosphere where people become calm. I noticed that some people start chatting and talking about worldly matters inside the mosque when they feel that they are in a social setting because of the intensity of the light.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">According to research, dim lighting can reduce stress hormones and increase melatonin, promoting a more relaxed atmosphere. Although dim lighting is great, always make sure to allow for adequate lighting for reading, aiming for 150 lux.</p>
<p>I also suggest having an option to increase the light to boost attentiveness during Friday prayers and lectures.<br><br><br></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpuq" class="font-bold">2-Colors:</h3>
<p>Avoid bright colors, especially inside the prayer hall. Colors should be neutral and do not distract the worshipers. That includes: <br>1-The carpets, especially the carpets! That's what the worshiper looks at when praying. There is a hadith in Bukhari and Muslim:</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed in a black cloak that had markings, and he looked at its markings. When he finished praying, he said: "Take this cloak to Abu Jahm ibn Hudhayfah, and bring me his plain garment, for they distracted me just now when I was praying." Hishaam ibn 'Urwah narrated from his father, from 'Aa'ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "I was looking at its markings whilst I was praying and I was afraid that they would distract me."</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The black cloak referred to (Khameesah) is a striped cloak made of silk or wool. The plain cloak referred to is a heavy cloak with no decoration on it.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">-The walls shouldn't be unnecessarily decorated with colorful tiles or such.</p>
<ul class="-mt-1 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">The Mihrab - It's the central piece of the mosque, and should not have distractions for the imam. Why do you need to have expensive decorations? Is this from the Deen? Why are you inventing?</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">I would say, that I have one exception that can be accepted, which is using high-quality materials. Such as marble, high quality wood or even high quality carpets (only not decorated ones as we discussed earlier) and that is to reduce the cost of long-term maintenance. So always use high-quality materials if possible.</li>
</ul>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">-The light fixtures/ chandeliers: Although these usually don't distract worshippers during prayer, as they are not in the field of view, chandeliers are expensive and do not usually make for an improvement of light quality.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">-I suggest having spots pointing towards the Minbar and lecture desk, highlighting the Imam/Lecturer.</p>
<ul class="-mt-1 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Although useful, I am actually against having a TV at the front of the prayer hall that displays the prayer times and events of the mosque. It makes it the center of attention, which obviously shouldn't be. I argue that the TV should be placed either outside the prayer hall in the patio, or at the back where it is not facing any worshippers that way you can see how much time is remaining for the Iqamah, events on the way out, and that's where you can engage in conversation such as planning to attend the lecture or when is the next prayer or the usual Iqamah times of the mosque. I argue that you shouldn't be waiting to get up to pray by the second, prayer should be a calm and stress free environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpur" class="font-bold">3-Furniture:</h2>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">It is ideal to have custom made furniture. Such as seats, tables, desks, shoe racks and shelves. Making everything blend together, doing this not only provides the mosque with better quality longer lasting items, but also improves the experience, reduces the variation in color and makes everything consistent. Avoid plastic chairs, as those are usually known to break quickly making it unsafe for old people and sick people who cannot perform Sujud.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpus" class="font-bold">4- Accessibility of Quran copies:</h2>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Here are the criteria of where Quran copies should be placed: a- Should be placed in Open shelves b- Should be accessible yet high enough for all ages above 10 YO. c- Should never be placed in closed drawers and book lockers, that only increases friction for the readers and some people might not want to draw attention for themselves opening and closing the lockers especially if they are not familiar with the mosque, plus they take a big space and require more maintenance. So a big no for having book lockers.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirput" class="font-bold"> The number of Quran copies placed in the hall of prayer.</h3>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I think there is an exaggeration for the number of copies placed. Not to discourage anyone from buying copies of the Quran and placing them in the mosques! NO that's not the point! I eagerly want to push my brothers and sisters to do so, but, instead of placing a 150 copies in a prayer hall that has at maximum 100 people, why not make a study and figure out the optimal number +some margin. And the rest can be placed in other mosques, or gifted to people who need a copy.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I would say that the study should be done in 2 times, Jumuah prayers and Ramadan. That should cover the highest periods of reading for the Quran.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpuu" class="font-bold">5- Acoustics</h2>
<p>Acoustics (no need for microphones if the surface of the mosque is small, provides a better experience, only microphone auxiliary if the imam does have a high voice.)<br>- Make sure that the women's prayer area and/or other floors can hear the Imam in case the electricity goes off.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpuv" class="font-bold">6- Women's Prayer Area</h2>
<p>If on the same level, one way tinted mirror separation, is optimal, so that allows women in their prayer area to see into the men’s prayer hall without being seen themselves. <br><br>This setup provides privacy for women while keeping them engaged and informed during prayers. Sujud tilawa, imam mistake, the gestures and body language of the imam at Jumuah Prayer etc... <br>The reflection of the mirror also makes the space in the men's prayer area feel bigger.</p>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv0" class="font-bold">III- Amenities:</h1>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv1" class="font-bold">Accessibility:</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center">We all know how unpleasant shoes on the floor are. Not only they are not pleasant to look at and create chaos, it also creates an accessibility issue.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/_468b4930-f83c-4863-962f-9d33bfea8d4f.jfif" alt="" width="354" height="354"></figure>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center">One of the most effective ways I've seen to combat this is having a "shoe-free" zone sticker at the entrance and access points of the prayer hall.<br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/_448c5795-3bc0-4ee1-9595-785562bb6626.jfif" alt="" width="507" height="507"></figure>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Shoe racks shouldn't be too far from the pathway to the entrance of the prayer hall, failing to do so will encourage people to just drop their shoes in the nearest and most convenient place, which is the floor. (Even when there are enough shoe racks).</p>
<ul class="-mt-1 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">If there are any steps in the entrance, having ramps and handrails in the access of the mosque is mandatory, I can't count the number of mosques I've been to that forget this simple detail.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv3" class="font-bold">Re-defining ablution areas:</h2>
<ol class="-mt-1 list-decimal space-y-2 pl-8">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Toilets should be outside the premises: In historic mosques you couldn't find toilets inside the premises of the mosque, only ablution areas, because there was no sewage system. I argue that this should be the same in our time.</li>
</ol>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Baz and the members of the committee appear to favor prohibition. It is mentioned in the fatwas of the Permanent Committee:</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The restroom must be separated so that it is outside the mosque, and there should be a wall between it and the mosque.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Ablution areas can be inside the mosque: فأباح ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما الوضوء من زمزم وهي في المسجد الحرام ونهى عن الاغتسال منها تنزيهاً للمسجد من التعري والاغتسال فيه من الجنابة</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Toilets and ablution areas must be separate, ideally, we can place an ablution area inside and outside (near to the toilets but separated of) the mosque.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Having ablution areas separate from the toilets makes walking barefoot allowed to avoid "Najasa". The prayer area and ablution area should be connected with a slip-resistance material, Which is far better than having flip-flops which are limited in number and may cause skin irritations. Also, this allows for feet to dry, keeping carpets clean and avoid getting them wet which makes them smell bad. And reduce the reliance of having paper towel to dry.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv4" class="font-bold">New Concept: Showers in Ablution Areas:</h3>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Since toilets are not inside the mosque they should include at least one shower, so that travelers that don't have a place to stay (or homeless people) can shower from Janabah or to clean themselves before entering the mosque. These showers should have a waterproof closet to put all of one's belongings. The number of showers should not be excessive, even in big mosques, so that the mosque does not become a destination for people to take showers. Just enough to serve the purpose.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv5" class="font-bold">Practical standard: estimate the number of faucets needed.</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ablution Estimation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average Ablution Time</strong>: 2 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Average Iqamah Time</strong>: 10 minutes (adjust based on your mosque's timings).</li>
<li><strong>People Needing Wudu</strong>:
<ul>
<li>15% in residential areas.</li>
<li>Up to 40% in commercial and non-residential areas.</li>
<li>Use 25% for mixed areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Formula</strong>:</p>
<pre class="language-matlab"><code>Number of Toilets Required= ((Maximum Number of Worshippers)×(Wudu Percentage/100)×(AIT+Allowance) )/ ( AAT×CC )
​
</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AIT</strong>: Average Iqamah Time ( in min )</li>
<li><strong>Allowance</strong>: Waiting allowance (in min)</li>
<li><strong>AAT</strong>: Average Ablution Time </li>
<li><strong>CC</strong>: Conversion Constant</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Waiting Allowance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum: 
<pre class="language-matlab"><code>−AIT+2</code></pre>
for lowest estimated wait time</li>
<li>Maximum: 6 for the highest allowance to reduce costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example Calculation</strong>:</p>
<pre class="language-matlab"><code>Number of Toilets= 
(1000×0.15) / (10+ (5/2)) = 150/12.5 =12</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimum and Minimum Number of Toilets</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimum Number</strong>:<code> Number of faucets / 2.</code></li>
<li><strong>Minimum Number</strong>:<code> Number of faucets / 3.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mosque Example</strong>:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Worshippers</strong>: 800</li>
<li><strong>Number of Faucets</strong>: 20</li>
<li><strong>Number of Toilets</strong>: 6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage Patterns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Days</strong>: 150 worshippers.</li>
<li><strong>Jumah Prayer</strong>: Full capacity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Days and Friday Prayers</strong>: The number of faucets is adequate.</li>
<li><strong>Waiting Times for Toilets</strong>: Acceptable waiting times on regular days but unacceptable during Friday prayers.
<p><strong>Using the formula above, and plugging values Targeting Minimum Cost</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Required Minimum Number of Faucets</strong>: 25</li>
<li>Minimum Number of Toilets: <code>25/3 = 8.3</code> rounded to 9. so this example doesn't even meet the minimum requirement of number of toilets.</li>
<li><strong>Optimum Number of Toilets:</strong><code> 25/2 = 12.5</code> rounded to 12. So for the above example, 6 toilets are missing for optimum waiting times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv7" class="font-bold">Ablution and toilet areas checklist:</h3>
<ul class="-mt-1 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Every Ablution area must have a mirror, a place to put small items (glasses, keys etc...), clothes hanger, soap dispenser.</li>
<li>Ensure proper drainage design, especially near the faucets. Standing in a puddle while you're trying to get clean it just defeats the purpose, doesn't it? </li>
<li>Design the floor with adequate slope towards drains to prevent water pooling around faucets. </li>
<li>Install low-flow faucets</li>
<li>dual-flush toilets, and other water-saving devices to minimize water use.</li>
<li>No need for ablution partitions in mosques; they're an unnecessary expense. Without partitions, people can perform ablution closer together, enhancing the sense of community and allowing adults to assist the young for example.</li>
<li>Ensure enough space and easy access in ablution areas for people with special needs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv8" class="font-bold">IV. Sustainability:</h1>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpv9">Building Materials:</h3>
<p>Using local materials not only improves the aesthetics of the mosque, as earthy, natural materials are often perceived as more calming and authentic but may, cost less, last longer and reduce environmental impact compared to synthetic materials.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpva" class="font-bold">Financial Sustainability:</h3>
<p>Mosques use X things that are the main expenses:<br><strong>- Electricity for lighting, heating and cooling</strong><br><strong>-Water for ablution and cleaning</strong><br><strong>- Salaries for services such as cleaning and maintenance.</strong><br><br>All of which can be made sustainable using these three things:<br><strong>- Natural ways of lighting, heating, and cooling + natural power generation.</strong></p>
<p>- Reuse ablution water for watering plants and flushing toilets. This reduces freshwater consumption and maintain the mosque's trees, which helps in cooling the surroundings.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><br>-<strong>A contributive maintenance system</strong><br><br>We highly encourage the usage of sustainable resources and alternative. such as natural ventilation, solar panels and the best practices we discussed throughout the article.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2024-07-23-182145.png" alt="" width="525" height="381" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2024-07-23-182145-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2024-07-23-182145-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2024-07-23-182145-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2024-07-23-182145-xl.png 1024w"></figure><br><br></p>
<p>If available, digging a well can be a good idea to ensure that water is always available and can help lower the water consumption cost in the long run.<br><br></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpvb" class="font-bold">Contributive maintenance system:</h3>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Maintaining and cleaning mosques should be the responsibility of all worshipers. I am pretty sure that all worshipers would be willing to contribute, however most people fear that they are getting involved in the responsibilities of the crew of the mosque.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">A Paper can be placed with periodic to-dos in adequate places. Mopping the ablution area, vacuum cleaning the carpet, etc...</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Everyone can contribute.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i3iv4nirpvc">Maintenance:</h3>
<p>Finally, I cannot stress the importance of regular maintenance. Mosques like every public space need thorough and regular maintenance. Failing to do so from the beginning will only lead to heightened expenses and a less enjoyable experience. <br>Here are some ways mosques can be financially sustainable:</p>
<ul class="-mt-1 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">If space allows it, having retail stores that can be rented out can bring in stable revenue.<br>This is perfectly allowed according to scholars:
<blockquote>It is permissible to have shops beneath the mosque that are rented out to support the mosque's needs.</blockquote>
Just make sure that these stores are clearly separated from the premises of the mosque.<br><br></li>
<li>Having a box of donation is great, which is better is having specific boxes by category that worshippers can put money, (box for tissue paper, paper for electricity and water contribution, box for re-painting the mosque, for bulbs etc...)</li>
</ul>

                <p>Wonder-less is a Chrome extension that limits the tabs opened. <br>I noticed that once I get past a certain point when opening tabs, I become distracted, overwhelmed, and less focused.</p>
<p><strong>Wonder-less is the solution.</strong></p>

</figure>
<p>Now the user can have multiple options to increase the flexibility and not limit completely the user, avoiding getting frustrated with the app. While not completely limiting the user, the Chrome extension should always keep the user mindful of the number of tabs opened and show alerts once that number is reached.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//Settings.png" alt="" width="1262" height="1041" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//responsive/Settings-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//responsive/Settings-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//responsive/Settings-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/6//responsive/Settings-xl.png 1024w"></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>I have kept the maximum number of tabs that can be opened to 20. Because giving the user flexibility on that aspect defies the extension's purpose. <br>If for some reason, the user wants to go over that limit, they can deactivate the extension.<br><br><br>This project did not progress beyond the design stage due to the release of Chrome's V3 update, which restricts access to certain features, including the ability to automatically close tabs.<br><br>But as I said in the Maker's Mindset blog: <br><br></p>

<p>"Safhaa" is an Islamic feed for Chrome's new tab. the premise is simple.<br><br></p>
<p>The new tab will serve as a place to<strong> drag and drop</strong> and organize different <strong>"components"</strong>. <br>The new tab will become a place for you to improve your spirituality as well as productivity. <br>So there are two main parts to the app:<br><strong>1-Spiritual Features</strong><br><strong>2- Productivity Features</strong><br><br></p>
<p>In this version, we will start with these components:</p>
<h4>Islamic Features:</h4>
<h3><br>- The time and date:</h3>
<p>(both in Hijri and Georgian calendars)<br>Ability to switch the primary date format. Either display the hijri as a main calendar or the Georgian.</p>

<h3>- Prayer Times:</h3>
<p><br>When the prayer time is close ( less than 10 minutes away ), the indicator turns red to subtly bring attention to the user that they should start preparing themselves for prayer.</p>

<h3><br>-Wisdom.</h3>
<p><br>The user can view quotes from the Quran and Hadith. The user should scroll until the bar on the right becomes filled to view the next Ayah or Hadith.<br>In the next version, we can add a button that takes the user to (quran.com) so they can continue reading from there and read the explanation as well. More awesome illustrations will be added إن شاء الله.</p>

<p>I noticed that unless I want to hear or memorize a specific Surah of the Quran, I want to just click and start listening without having to spend time choosing what to listen to. sometimes giving up control is better. Just click on the start button and you start listening right away.</p>

<p>- Focus timer simpler Pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>I have always liked focused sprints. however, I find that I only use them to make me aware of the time I am spending, not to take a break. <br>Usually, when I use the Pomodoro technique, I just get distracted when the timer goes and "reminds me to take a break". <br>I work in 15-minute sprints, and that keeps me focused on the task at hand, if the timer goes off and I find myself distracted, I get back to the main thing. I take breaks when I feel like I need it, not systematically. we are not robots.<br><br></p>

                <p> </p>
<p>"The Maker's Contract" is inspired by "The Cult of Done Manifesto". I discovered this piece of writing not too long ago, and I feel that it is the best thing that I have read that resonates with someone who is a polymath like me. So here's my version of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are three states for a maker:<br><strong>1- Not knowing </strong><br><strong>2- Working on the project </strong><br><strong>3- Publishing/Launching it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1.png" alt="The stages of making" width="1920" height="1080" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-xl.png 1024w"></figure>
<p>If you do not know something, you should research it. If you have researched it for a few hours, then in theory, you should be knowledgeable about that subject more than someone who has never encountered it before. You can, in fact, share what you know with them; that counts in my book as knowing it. So you should move on to the action phase; you should work on that project without getting distracted by learning. Because learning snaps you out of the maker state. Researching more won't make your work perfect because: Everything is a draft.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<figure class="post__image"><strong>Accept that everything is a draft. </strong>It helps to get it done/published. <br>What is unseen counts for nothing. Would you rather ship work that can marginally help someone or never ship anything? Would you rather share what you have learned in those hours you have spent and give a shortcut to someone, or keep on learning without any fruits bearing?<br>Always go for sharing your draft; it's infinitely better than zero. Plus, your work will always be a draft; no one is ever 100% satisfied with their work at least if they keep learning.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1-copy.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xl.png 1024w"></figure>

<li>
<figure class="post__image"><strong>There is no editing stage:</strong> You will get used to no editing because you won't need editing. This is for advanced makers.<br>For beginner makers, try to restrict yourself from editing the small stuff. Just focus on getting the 80%+ right.<br>Editing kills your momentum.<br>Don't edit unless it’s something crucial and really affects the main objective of what you're making.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1-copy-2.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-xl.png 1024w"></figure>

<figure class="post__image">You won't know everything in advance. <strong>Making is the only way to learn.<br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-xl.png 1024w"></figure><br></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the first 15 minutes. What can I make in the following 15 minutes? Start there. Don't think about the end yet.<br><strong>Try to publish your work in the fewest number of 15-minute intervals possible.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/15mins-2.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-xl.png 1024w"></figure></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hate perfection. </strong>It's tedious and won't move the needle. It stops you from making and sharing stuff. Perfection is the enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a human, you are not perfect. If you want to be perfect, never do anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you fail, that counts as done.</strong> Only in this case, you can go back to the learning phase. And maybe you discover that this project isn't as fun or interesting as you thought. Even then, the advantage of failing is you won't say: "what if?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Have a place to publish your work.</strong> That way you know it is done. That way you stop your perfectionism and the countless unpublished work. <br><strong>Unpublished work = Unfinished work.</strong><br><strong> Published work = Made work.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/publish.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-xl.png 1024w"></figure></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To be a maker, you have to think differently. You cannot afford to wander around too much when executing your project. You have to have a certain can-do attitude. It's necessary to wonder; however, once you start making, you have to engage in what you do and stop learning.</p>
<figure class="post__image">There's a time for learning and there is a time for making. Once you have learned enough about the subject, you should execute. Granted, I am talking to people who already have experience and have been exploring different fields for a long time. But they are stuck either in the research phase or the perfectionist phase. I am not talking about someone who is just starting out.<br><br><strong>Go make something. now.</strong><br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Go-make-something-wallpaper.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-xl.png 1024w"></figure>

                <p>The column grid system is the key to consistent designs.💻</p>
<p>Before I have started using it, I felt that it was constraining and thought it was not worth it to use it. <br><br>However once I saw the dramatic improvements I always start my design process with it. <br><br>Whether it's a website, a mobile app or even a poster or minimalistic illustration (like the 'Minima' wallpaper set I'm working on which I am super excited about).  </p>
<p>The grid system gives structure to the design, it's more than making allignments easier, it makes the whole design consistent and gives appropriate breathing room for elements.</p>
