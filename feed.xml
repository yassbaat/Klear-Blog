<p>لنصنع "صفحة"  </p>
<p>"Safhaa" is an Islamic feed for Chrome's new tab. the premise is simple.<br><br></p>
<p>The new tab will serve as a place to<strong> drag and drop</strong> and organize different <strong>"components"</strong>. <br>The new tab will become a place for you to improve your spirituality as well as productivity. <br>So there are two main parts to the app:<br><strong>1-Spiritual Features</strong><br><strong>2- Productivity Features</strong><br><br></p>
<p>In this version, we will start with these components:</p>
<h4>Islamic Features:</h4>
<h3><br>- The time and date:</h3>
<p>(both in Hijri and Georgian calendars)<br>Ability to switch the primary date format. Either display the hijri as a main calendar or the Georgian.</p>

<h3>- Prayer Times:</h3>
<p><br>When the prayer time is close ( less than 10 minutes away ), the indicator turns red to subtly bring attention to the user that they should start preparing themselves for prayer.</p>
<figure ><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/prayer-times.png" alt="" width="2880" height="1062" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/prayer-times-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/prayer-times-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/prayer-times-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/prayer-times-xl.png 1024w"></figure>

<figcaption >the same concept is valid for the color system, if prayer time &lt; 10 minutes, the color pallete turns red.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3><br>-Wisdom.</h3>
<p><br>The user can view quotes from the Quran and Hadith. The user should scroll until the bar on the right becomes filled to view the next Ayah or Hadith.<br>In the next version, we can add a button that takes the user to (quran.com) so they can continue reading from there and read the explanation as well. More awesome illustrations will be added إن شاء الله.</p>

<p><br>- Reminders of the next important Islamic event <br><br>such as fasting specific dates (Achoura'a or Monday and Thursday) or a reminder of certain important dates such as the new Hijri year.</p>
<h3><br>- Show one of Allah's 99 Names.</h3>
<p>The purpose is to familiarize with them and to eventually memorize them and know their meaning. Clicking the element opens a link explaining the name in [ islamweb.com ] [ look for an article link for every name on Islamweb ]</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Productivity Features:</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center">- A quick way to search using Google/YouTube or ask a quick question for AI (ChatGpt).<br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/Frame-1-3.png" alt="" width="1358" height="682" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/Frame-1-3-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/Frame-1-3-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/Frame-1-3-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/Frame-1-3-xl.png 1024w"></figure><br>- Weather quick glance.<br><br></p>

<p>- White noise (sharia-compliant)</p>
<p><br>-Quran radio:</p>
<p>I noticed that unless I want to hear or memorize a specific Surah of the Quran, I want to just click and start listening without having to spend time choosing what to listen to. sometimes giving up control is better. Just click on the start button and you start listening right away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Focus timer simpler Pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>I have always liked focused sprints. however, I find that I only use them to make me aware of the time I am spending, not to take a break. <br>Usually, when I use the Pomodoro technique, I just get distracted when the timer goes and "reminds me to take a break". <br>I work in 15-minute sprints, and that keeps me focused on the task at hand, if the timer goes off and I find myself distracted, I get back to the main thing. I take breaks when I feel like I need it, not systematically. we are not robots.<br><br></p>

                <p> </p>
<p>"The Maker's Contract" is inspired by "The Cult of Done Manifesto". I discovered this piece of writing not too long ago, and I feel that it is the best thing that I have read that resonates with someone who is a polymath like me. So here's my version of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are three states for a maker:<br><strong>1- Not knowing </strong><br><strong>2- Working on the project </strong><br><strong>3- Publishing/Launching it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1.png" alt="The stages of making" width="1920" height="1080" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-xl.png 1024w"></figure>
<p>If you do not know something, you should research it. If you have researched it for a few hours, then in theory, you should be knowledgeable about that subject more than someone who has never encountered it before. You can, in fact, share what you know with them; that counts in my book as knowing it. So you should move on to the action phase; you should work on that project without getting distracted by learning. Because learning snaps you out of the maker state. Researching more won't make your work perfect because: Everything is a draft.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<figure class="post__image"><strong>Accept that everything is a draft. </strong>It helps to get it done/published. <br>What is unseen counts for nothing. Would you rather ship work that can marginally help someone or never ship anything? Would you rather share what you have learned in those hours you have spent and give a shortcut to someone, or keep on learning without any fruits bearing?<br>Always go for sharing your draft; it's infinitely better than zero. Plus, your work will always be a draft; no one is ever 100% satisfied with their work at least if they keep learning.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1-copy.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xl.png 1024w"></figure>
</li>
<li>
<figure class="post__image"><strong>There is no editing stage:</strong> You will get used to no editing because you won't need editing. This is for advanced makers.<br>For beginner makers, try to restrict yourself from editing the small stuff. Just focus on getting the 80%+ right.<br>Editing kills your momentum.<br>Don't edit unless it’s something crucial and really affects the main objective of what you're making.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1-copy-2.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-2-xl.png 1024w"></figure>
</li>
<li>
<figure class="post__image">You won't know everything in advance. <strong>Making is the only way to learn.<br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/making-is-the-only-way-to-learn-xl.png 1024w"></figure><br></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the first 15 minutes. What can I make in the following 15 minutes? Start there. Don't think about the end yet.<br><strong>Try to publish your work in the fewest number of 15-minute intervals possible.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/15mins-2.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/15mins-2-xl.png 1024w"></figure></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hate perfection. </strong>It's tedious and won't move the needle. It stops you from making and sharing stuff. Perfection is the enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a human, you are not perfect. If you want to be perfect, never do anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you fail, that counts as done.</strong> Only in this case, you can go back to the learning phase. And maybe you discover that this project isn't as fun or interesting as you thought. Even then, the advantage of failing is you won't say: "what if?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Have a place to publish your work.</strong> That way you know it is done. That way you stop your perfectionism and the countless unpublished work. <br><strong>Unpublished work = Unfinished work.</strong><br><strong> Published work = Made work.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/publish.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/publish-xl.png 1024w"></figure></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To be a maker, you have to think differently. You cannot afford to wander around too much when executing your project. You have to have a certain can-do attitude. It's necessary to wonder; however, once you start making, you have to engage in what you do and stop learning.</p>
<figure class="post__image">There's a time for learning and there is a time for making. Once you have learned enough about the subject, you should execute. Granted, I am talking to people who already have experience and have been exploring different fields for a long time. But they are stuck either in the research phase or the perfectionist phase. I am not talking about someone who is just starting out.<br><br><strong>Go make something. now.</strong><br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Go-make-something-wallpaper.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Go-make-something-wallpaper-xl.png 1024w"></figure>

                <p>The column grid system is the key to consistent designs.💻</p>
<p>Before I have started using it, I felt that it was constraining and thought it was not worth it to use it. <br><br>However once I saw the dramatic improvements I always start my design process with it. <br><br>Whether it's a website, a mobile app or even a poster or minimalistic illustration (like the 'Minima' wallpaper set I'm working on which I am super excited about).  </p>
<p>The grid system gives structure to the design, it's more than making allignments easier, it makes the whole design consistent and gives appropriate breathing room for elements.</p>
