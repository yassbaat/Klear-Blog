I discovered this piece of writing not too long ago, and I feel that it is the best thing that I have read that resonates with someone who is a polymath like me. So here's my version of it.</p><ul><li>There are three states for a maker:<br><strong>1- Not knowing</strong><br><strong>2- Working on the project</strong><br><strong>3- Publishing/Launching it.</strong></li></ul><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1.png" alt="The stages of making" width="1920" height="1080" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-xs.png 320w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-sm.png 480w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-md.png 768w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-xl.png 1024w"></figure><p>If you do not know something, you should research it. If you have researched it for a few hours, then in theory, you should be knowledgeable about that subject more than someone who has never encountered it before. You can, in fact, share what you know with them; that counts in my book as knowing it. So you should move on to the action phase; you should work on that project without getting distracted by learning. Because learning snaps you out of the maker state. Researching more won't make your work perfect because: Everything is a draft.</p><ul><li><figure class="post__image"><strong>Accept that everything is a draft. </strong>It helps to get it done/published.<br>What is unseen counts for nothing. Would you rather ship work that can marginally help someone or never ship anything? Would you rather share what you have learned in those hours you have spent and give a shortcut to someone, or keep on learning without any fruits bearing?<br>Always go for sharing your draft; it's infinitely better than zero. Plus, your work will always be a draft; no one is ever 100% satisfied with their work at least if they keep learning.<br><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1-copy.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xs.png 320w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-sm.png 480w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-md.png 768w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xl.png 1024w"></figure></li><li><figure class="post__image"><strong>There is no editing stage:</strong> You will get used to no editing because you won't need editing.

You cannot afford to wander around too much when executing your project. You have to have a certain can-do attitude. It's necessary to wonder; however, once you start making, you have to engage in what you do and stop learning.</p><figure class="post__image">There's a time for learning and there is a time for making. Once you have learned enough about the subject, you should execute. Granted, I am talking to people who already have experience and have been exploring different fields for a long time.
