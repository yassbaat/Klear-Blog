Agriculture, industrial production should be the main focus.Â </p><p>3rd world countries have a huge problem which is that they try to emitate developed countries. If tourism works for them, it doesn't necessarly work for you.Â <br>Â <br>You only attract low quality tourists if you are not well developed as a country.<br><br><br>We should focus on the needs of our people.<br>The usury system "Riba" is the cancer that puts the money of the country in the hands of the few.<br><br>There was a reason why Geramny was the most prospourous country in the world in the 1930's while the US, USRR and the rest of european countries were strugguling with the great depressionon, they don't teach you that in the history books, don't they?<br><br>As Hitler did, we should oust the bankers that deal with usury.<br>We should put the capital at the service of the people. This is the core of the Islamic economic system. Never for the purpose of speculation. Only linked to real assets and values.<br><br><br>Taxes are absolutely unacceptable. Taxles should be organic, meaning, they should not be a sum that is taken at the end of the transactions. They should be justified, just like sales, for example:<br>- There should be no tax on vehicle circualtion, the government should sell gasoline for a profit in a way that covers the building , the expansion and the maintenance of roads.<br><br><br><br>Roadmap:<br>- Remove dealing with Usury.Â <br>Loans should be given out at zero percent intrest. The goverment this way stimulates the economy,Â <br>- Remove all forms of taxes on local people.Â <br>- Prices should be stabilized at all cost, inflation is a hoax. Inflation is the result of the banking system, which pushes speculation and flactuation to serve the purpose of the elite. while everyone else suffers.<br>While it is difficult for prices to stay the same especially for imported goods. The government should work on stabilzing what it could produce locally. Especially food related items. One would say that all prices are linked, so people working in the food industry would struggle to buy imported items and that nonbody will want to work in that field. Wrong. Since local people would have 0% tax, that alone should motivate them to work in these sectors. The government would then use the tax collected on foreign companies to hedge the inflation and the price increases of imported goods.<br>- Focus on producing all the necessary goods for your people. This would make your state truly independent.Â <br><br></p><h4>Your un-employed people are your best asset.Â </h4><p>un-employed people should be forced to pick sectors to work in, that could be using the mandatory military service. Either in Agriculture or Industry mega projects or any productive field of activity.<br>Hunders of thousands of un-employed people would be turned into a huge asset.<br>With the adequate practical training these people could turn into a skilled workforce.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2024-06-28T11:52">Jun 28, 2024</time></div><div class="post__share"></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__section post__related"><div class="main__inner"><h3 class="post__section__title">Related post</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__meta"><div class="c-card__author"><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/authors/klear/">Klear</a></div><time datetime="2024-03-13T12:53">Mar 13, 2024 </time><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/tags/learning/" class="c-card-tag">Learning</a></div><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/the-makers-mindset/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Thumbnail-maker-mindset-2.png" srcset="https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Thumbnail-maker-mindset-2-xs.png 320w, https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Thumbnail-maker-mindset-2-sm.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 700px) 200px, (min-width: 480px) 160px, calc(100vw - 50px)" loading="lazy" height="1501" width="2001" alt=""></a><header class="c-card__header"><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/the-makers-mindset/">&quot;The Maker&#x27;s Contract&quot;.</a></h2><p>"The Maker's Contract" is inspired by "The Cult of Done Manifesto".
