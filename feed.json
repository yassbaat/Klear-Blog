            "content_html": "<p>Don't read any other startup ideas guide, if you ever feel lost, just open this blog and you will find everything you need. <br><br><br>Here's a checklist for choosing the idea. Try to check most of these boxes, if you don't you might run into big problems:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>0- Avoid solving cool problems, vitamins. The bill spliting app, the habit tracker, the cool social app. Go for pain killers. No only that but also, avoid consumer products.<br><br>1- Ideas Must be B2B.<br>It has to solve Business problems, avoid customer problems like the plague! <br><strong><br>All successfull startups are B2B! with the exeption of games and arbitrage i.e retail) ( I would argue that even arbitrage ideas like amazon are only successful because they help business owners sell on their platform. ) <br>This advice also applies for standard brick and mortar Retail businesses. The ones that are successful if they allow other people to make money with them - through franchising.  </strong></p>\n<p>people look at these the other way around because most people are consumers, they think google helps people find content, airbnb lists cool places to rent, and uber as a replacement for taxis for the masses<br>the correct way to look at it is: (business owners run ads so they need google, Tenants rent houses so they need a place to post , drivers find leads so there's uber) <br>So if you are not helping businesses you're in trouble almost all of the time.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>- Pick something that has a big demand, and low supply ( of companies and people that want to work on ) </p>\n<p>- Pick an idea that solves valuable problems and companies are willing to pay for. Don't pick cheap problems. Competition can be a good indicator of things that people are paying for. However tough competition is for losers. Never go for the easiest low-hanging fruits if you don't want to become a slave for the business. At least pick something with a high barrier to entry. For example, there are fewer people designing full apps than social media banners. There's a higher barrier to entry and knowledge pre-requisites. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Solving more valuable problems, bigger problems can be easier:<br>a-  Customers want to sign up because they need that pain to be solved.<br>b- you get more press attention.<br>c-Smart people want to join, fund and work at your startup.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>- Solve your own problem, you have to be your first customer, or at least you have to know someone that wants to use your product. If you woudn't want to use your product who will??</p>\n<p>- Target a niche at the beginning, world domination later. Always start with a sub-set you can target and dominate quickly then expand. Facebook-standanford, airbnb -NYC , Amazon-books.<br>- In a way, this is a technique of marketing, just a very good one.  it's a very high converting technique, because you have a higher chance at making these people trust you and listen to you. as opposed to some random ad that they have seen the first itme in their live on a random webiste. <br>you have to have a marketing plan in place, how are you going to target these people?<br>In a way, billboards, TV, and advertising through sponsoring Youtube channels or very well known blogs ( such as doing interviews or having your own following) is very effective because it gives you authority, and people belive that you have money and that you can help them.</p>\n<p><br><br><br><br><br><br>The last step to Choosing the idea. You have to have a certain conviction of your ideas.<br>If you stick to all the criteria above, your idea should work إن شاء الله .<br>But even if you have the best idea, you will get nowhere if you ditch it and pivot every few months. you will get nowhere guaranteed. So please. Stick to one idea, choose something that you find interesting. Then find a way to motivate yourself to keep working on it. </p>\n<p>You should work on one thing. Using one stack that you become professional at. Reduce changing the variables, especially completely changing the project.<br><br><br><br>----<br>Having a routine will make you look superhuman, doing the same thing over and over will make your returns exponatial, because people will look at your achivements and try to compare your results after doing the same thing for years to themselves when they are starting or trying to do it for the first time! Never fall for this trap!<br>When I started training kicboxing, I thought that other people are stronger, tolarate  <br><br><br><br><br><br>-----<br>Retail Ideas - <br>retails ideas are different beast.

            "content_html": "<h1>بسم الله</h1>\n<p>Chapters:<br>1- Design Basics &amp; overall principles<br>2- </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Design Basics &amp; Principles:</h3>\n<p>I am not here to critique the mosque designs.</p>\n<p>I am here to provide a perspective on how we can improve and implement design principles that can help elevate the experience of worshipers, make the environment more peaceful and calm. Adhering to the principles of the prophet to avoid any kind of distraction when praying.</p>\n<p>The principle that I want every muslim to always have in mind, wether they are designing a mosque or just praying in it is: <br><strong>How can we improve the user experience in mosques for our fellow Muslims?<br></strong><br>Solving the issues that nobody talks about is almost always the highest value.<br>Solving a UX challenge for users, while the current solution in place is good enough. <br><br>Almost anyone can solve issues when they are apparent, the real challenge is to feel the pain of something that is not easily seen. Everyone can pick up something when they see it has fallen because it's easy physical work, our job as designers is to prevent that thing from falling in the first place, the designer sees what most people don't even notice.</p>\n<p>We will discuss many of these non-apparant issues, but just as an appetizer here's an example:<br>Every mosque should have a signs system, while people can ask each other and waste time looking for what they need. we could save so much time for worshipers by making a reliable, consistent sign system accross all mosques in a city or country. That way we remove the guessing time and effort. I remember once praying in a city I've never been to (Rafraf), and the main mosque has the abolution area underground, I thought I was going to be early for the prayer but I kept looking for 5 minutes and couldn't figure where it was, so I asked two people that gave me directions that weren't accurate, because they assume that it is easy because they pray there everyday. so I kept looking and eventually when people started coming and performing Wudhu at that moment I saw where </p>\n<h3><br>Designing Mosque Signs Guide:</h3>\n<p>1- A sign of the mosque name. There were times, that I didn't even notice that there is a mosque just because there were no sign. Having signs with the mosque name makes it easier for the community to use the mosque as a reference and meeting point. I.e there is a lecture in \"Asala\" mosque, or that shop is near that mosque. etc... <br>it helps the community facilitate having mosques as a geographical and spiritual reference.</p>\n<p>2- Overview all amenities, this should be placed at the entry of the mosque. If there is a prayer hall in the first stair, abulution place, women prayer hall</p>\n<p>2- Abulution sign, must placed in the entry of the mosque, as well as near the main prayer hall, since most people can easily identify the prayer hall - because it's the main focus of the architecture.<br><br>The sign for the women prayer room should also be visible in the men’s  section. Because usually, when a woman wants to pray, the men go first looking and asking if there’s a women’s prayer hall. so even if the women’s designated prayer area is far form the men’s , a sign should be present showing the direction of the women’s prayer area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5- The placement of Quran copies. <br>Here are the criteria of where Quran copies should be placed:<br>a- Should be placed in Open shelves<br>b- Should be accessible yet high enough for all ages above 10 YO.<br>c- Should never be placed in closed drawers and book lockers, that only increases friction for the readers and some people might not want to draw attention for themselves opening and closing the lockers especially if they are not familiar with the mosque, plus they take a big space and require more maintenance. So a big no for having book lockers.<br><br><br></p>\n<p>6- The number of Quran copies places in the hall of prayer. <br>I think there is an exaggeration for the number of copies placed. Not to discourage anyone from buying copies of the Quran and placing them in the mosques! NO that's not the point! <br>I eagerly want to push my brothers and sisters to do so, but, instead of placing a 150 copies in a prayer hall that has at maximum 100 people, why not make a study and figure out the optimal number +some margin. And the rest can be placed in other mosques, or gifted to people who need a copy.</p>\n<p>I would say that the study should be done in 2 times, Jumuah prayers and Ramadan. That should cover the highest periods of reading for the Quran. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Chapter 2: <br>Increasing خشوع :<br><br></h2>\n<h4>1- Lights:</h4>\n<p>a- Having natural light inside the prayer hall is crucial. I don't prefer it when I go to some mosques at Thu'hr or Asr and find the lights turned on. I feel that I am at an office. Prayer should make one feel relaxed and having lights turned on at that time somewhat makes me tense. Yet not too much natural light, </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-xs.jpg 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-sm.jpg 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-md.jpg 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/masjid-bab-al-salam-altqadum_5-xl.jpg 1024w\"><figcaption>A great example of  natural lighting</figcaption></figure>\n<p><br><br>b- Lights should always, always, always be warm please. Never have fluorescent bulbs please. Night prayers are close to people's bedtimes, and having white light will not only disrupt some people's sleep but is not calming! 4500K + <br>c- lights should be on the dim side. that instanly creates an atmosphere where people become calm. I noticed that some people start chatting and talking about worldly matters inside the mosque when they feel that they are in a social setting because of the intensity of the light.</p>\n<h5>Colors:</h5>\n<p>Avoid bright colors, especially inside the prayer hall. Colors should be neutral and do not distract the worshipers. <br>that includes: <br>1-The carpets, especially the carpets! That's where the worshiper looks at when praying.<br>There is a hadith in Bukhari and Muslim:</p>\n<p>\" the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed in a black cloak that had markings, and he looked at its markings. When he finished praying, he said: “Take this cloak to Abu Jahm ibn Hudhayfah, and bring me his plain garment, for they distracted me just now when I was praying.”. Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah narrated from his father, from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I was looking at its markings whilst I was praying and I was afraid that they would distract me.” </p>\n<p>The black cloak referred to (Khameesah) is a striped cloak made of silk or wool. <br>The plain cloak referred to is a heavy cloak with no decoration on it. </p>\n<p>-The walls. <br>- The Mihrab - It's the central piece of the mosque, and should not have distractions for the imam. Why do you need to have expensive deccorations? is this from the Deen? Why are you inventing? <br>- I would say, that I have one exception that can be accepted, which is using high-quality materials. Such as marble, high quality wood or even high quality carpets ( only not decorated ones as we discussed earlier) and that is to reduce the cost of long-term maintenance. So always use high-quality materials if possible.<br><br><br>-The light fixtures/ chandeliers <br>-</p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________<br>To be continued.</p>",

If you have researched it for a few hours, then in theory, you should be knowledgeable about that subject more than someone who has never encountered it before. You can, in fact, share what you know with them; that counts in my book as knowing it. So you should move on to the action phase; you should work on that project without getting distracted by learning. Because learning snaps you out of the maker state. Researching more won't make your work perfect because: Everything is a draft.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><strong>Accept that everything is a draft. </strong>It helps to get it done/published. <br>What is unseen counts for nothing. Would you rather ship work that can marginally help someone or never ship anything? Would you rather share what you have learned in those hours you have spent and give a shortcut to someone, or keep on learning without any fruits bearing?<br>Always go for sharing your draft; it's infinitely better than zero. Plus, your work will always be a draft; no one is ever 100% satisfied with their work at least if they keep learning.<br><br><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/Artboard-1-copy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1081\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xs.png 320w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-sm.png 480w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-md.png 768w ,https://klear.pages.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/Artboard-1-copy-xl.png 1024w\"></figure>\n</li>\n<li>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><strong>There is no editing stage:</strong> You will get used to no editing because you won't need editing.
