Try to check most of these boxes, if you don't you might run into big problems:</p><p> </p><p>0- Avoid solving cool problems, vitamins. The bill spliting app, the habit tracker, the cool social app. Go for pain killers. No only that but also, avoid consumer products.<br><br>1- Ideas Must be B2B.<br>It has to solve Business problems, avoid customer problems like the plague!<br><strong><br>All successfull startups are B2B! with the exeption of games and arbitrage i.e retail) ( I would argue that even arbitrage ideas like amazon are only successful because they help business owners sell on their platform. ) <br>This advice also applies for standard brick and mortar Retail businesses. The ones that are successful if they allow other people to make money with them - through franchising.  </strong></p><p>people look at these the other way around because most people are consumers, they think google helps people find content, airbnb lists cool places to rent, and uber as a replacement for taxis for the masses<br>the correct way to look at it is: (business owners run ads so they need google, Tenants rent houses so they need a place to post , drivers find leads so there's uber) <br>So if you are not helping businesses you're in trouble almost all of the time.  </p><p> </p><p>- Pick something that has a big demand, and low supply ( of companies and people that want to work on ) </p><p>- Pick an idea that solves valuable problems and companies are willing to pay for. Don't pick cheap problems. Competition can be a good indicator of things that people are paying for. However tough competition is for losers. Never go for the easiest low-hanging fruits if you don't want to become a slave for the business. At least pick something with a high barrier to entry. For example, there are fewer people designing full apps than social media banners. There's a higher barrier to entry and knowledge pre-requisites. </p><p> </p><p>Solving more valuable problems, bigger problems can be easier:<br>a-  Customers want to sign up because they need that pain to be solved.<br>b- you get more press attention.<br>c-Smart people want to join, fund and work at your startup.</p><p> </p><p>- Solve your own problem, you have to be your first customer, or at least you have to know someone that wants to use your product. If you woudn't want to use your product who will??</p><p>- Target a niche at the beginning, world domination later. Always start with a sub-set you can target and dominate quickly then expand. Facebook-standanford, airbnb -NYC , Amazon-books.<br>- In a way, this is a technique of marketing, just a very good one.  it's a very high converting technique, because you have a higher chance at making these people trust you and listen to you. as opposed to some random ad that they have seen the first itme in their live on a random webiste.<br>you have to have a marketing plan in place, how are you going to target these people?<br>In a way, billboards, TV, and advertising through sponsoring Youtube channels or very well known blogs ( such as doing interviews or having your own following) is very effective because it gives you authority, and people belive that you have money and that you can help them.</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br>The last step to Choosing the idea. You have to have a certain conviction of your ideas.<br>If you stick to all the criteria above, your idea should work إن شاء الله .<br>But even if you have the best idea, you will get nowhere if you ditch it and pivot every few months. you will get nowhere guaranteed. So please. Stick to one idea, choose something that you find interesting. Then find a way to motivate yourself to keep working on it. </p><p>You should work on one thing. Using one stack that you become professional at. Reduce changing the variables, especially completely changing the project.<br><br><br><br>----<br>Having a routine will make you look superhuman, doing the same thing over and over will make your returns exponatial, because people will look at your achivements and try to compare your results after doing the same thing for years to themselves when they are starting or trying to do it for the first time! Never fall for this trap!<br>When I started training kicboxing, I thought that other people are stronger, tolarate  <br><br><br><br><br><br>-----<br>Retail Ideas - <br>retails ideas are different beast. If you have a physical or a retail business.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2024-04-08T02:05">Apr 8, 2024</time></div><div class="post__share"></div></footer></div></article></main><div class="right-bar"><div class="right-bar__inner"><div class="sidebar"><section class="box tags"><h3 class="box__title">Recommended Topics</h3><ul class="tags__list"><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/tags/design/" class="btn btn--gray">Design <sup>(2)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/tags/islam/" class="btn btn--gray">Islam <sup>(2)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://klear.pages.dev/tags/learning/" class="btn btn--gray">Learning <sup>(2)</sup></a></li></ul></section></div></div></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://klear.pages.dev/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
