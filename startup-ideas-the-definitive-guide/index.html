Not only that but also, avoid consumer products. Go where the money is, where the money is spent, solve problems that potentially can make money for other people (businesses)<br><br>1- Ideas Must be B2B.<br>It has to solve business problems - avoid customer problems like the plague!<br><strong><br>All successful startups are B2B!<br>with the exception of games and arbitrage i.e retail) ( I would argue that even arbitrage ideas like Amazon are only successful because they help business owners sell on their platform. ) <br>This advice also applies to standard brick and mortar Retail businesses. The ones that are successful if they allow other people to make money with them - through franchising.  </strong></p><p>People look at these the other way around because most people are consumers, they think Google helps people find content, Airbnb lists cool places to rent, and Uber as a replacement for taxis for the masses<br>the correct way to look at it is: (business owners run ads so they need Google, Tenants rent houses so they need a place to post, drivers find leads so there's Uber) <br>So if you are not helping businesses you're in trouble almost all of the time.  </p><p> </p><p>- Ideally, Pick something that has a big demand, and low supply ( of companies and people that want to work on it) <br>-The second best thing to do is to copy something that's working and make a relevant twist on it (big or small).</p><p>- Pick an idea that solves valuable problems and companies are willing to pay for. Don't pick cheap problems. Competition can be a good indicator of things that people are paying for. However tough competition is for losers. Never go for the easiest low-hanging fruits if you don't want to become a slave for the business. At least pick something with a high barrier to entry. For example, there are fewer people designing full apps than social media banners. There's a higher barrier to entry and knowledge prerequisites. </p><p> </p><p>Solving more valuable problems, bigger problems can be easier:<br>a-  Customers want to sign up because they need that pain to be solved.<br>b- you get more press attention.<br>c-Smart people want to join, fund, and work at your startup.</p><p> </p><p>- Solve your own problem, you have to be your first customer, or at least you have to know someone who wants to use your product. If you wouldn't want to use your product who will??</p><p>- Target a niche at the beginning, world domination later. Always start with a sub-set you can target and dominate quickly then expand. Facebook-standanford, Airbnb -NYC , Amazon-books.<br>- In a way, this is a technique of marketing, just a very good one.  it's a very high-converting technique. You have a higher chance of making these people trust you and listen to you. as opposed to some random ad that they have seen the first time in their life on a random website.<br>You have to have a marketing plan in place, how are you going to target these people?<br>In a way, billboards, TV, and advertising through sponsoring Youtube channels or very well-known blogs ( such as doing interviews or having your own following) is very effective because it gives you authority, and people believe that you have money and that you can help them.</p><p>- Another variation of this is selling in Marketplaces of established companies. Think B2B always. Shopify, Stripe etc... These have potential customers with a lot of money and you gain the trust of the platform as you are not a no-name website that can be fraudulent. Solve problems, make improvements to the platform and you have a good chance to get customers.<br><br><br>- Choose one idea, one stack, one feature to ship ( the most important feature ). If the idea is complex, then ship an MFP ( minimum functional Product).<br>Run super-targeted ads to the landing page, if you are solving a pain point, you should be able to get users.<br><br><br><br><br>The last step to Choosing the idea. You have to have a certain conviction of your ideas.<br>If you stick to all the criteria above, your idea should work إن شاء الله .<br>But even if you have the best idea, you will get nowhere if you ditch it and pivot every few months. you will get nowhere guaranteed. So please. Stick to one idea, choose something that you find interesting. Then find a way to motivate yourself to keep working on it. </p><p>You should work on one thing. Using one stack that you become professional at. Reduce changing the variables, especially completely changing the project.<br>Remember, serial tasking not multi-tasking. Work on one project at a time. You will never get anywhere if you have more than one destination. For the projects that don't work, stop them and choose one. Never dabble shallowly between tasks, you get paid for intensity and solving a problem well.<br><br><br><br>A small word about pricing:<br>If you want to have a competitive startup even in competitive niches. Offer more free features. Don't charge them anything and don't offer free trials. When they get used to using your software, you strike and you strike hard. without showing generic paywalls or annoying them, blurring the feature that they want to use. An amazing example of this is Crisp, they let you use all the features, but then if you exceed a certain amount of messages, and become a power user, they blurr out the chat history, with XXXX so that it makes it super frustrating for the user as they probably remember those conversations and feel the need to stay connected or go back and see what where the questions of those users.<br>Another amazing example of this is Pieter Level's Make book. He lets you read the first few chapters for free, and then, boom, as you become hooked to the book, some of the words become confuscated, however, you can continue to read and get the gist of the meaning. until you don't. You become frustrated, trying to decrypt it or find a way to unlock it and you can't so you don't have anything but buying the book.<br><br><br><br><br>----<br>Having a routine will make you look superhuman, doing the same thing over and over will make your returns exponential, because people will look at your achievements and try to compare your results after doing the same thing for years to themselves when they are starting or trying to do it for the first time! Never fall for this trap!<br>When I started training kicboxing, I thought that other people were stronger, tolarate more pain. There's an exercise where we kick a tire, to condition our chin. It really hurts. And I was surprised how painful it is the first time I kicked it, and here was some people kicking it so hard I thought I was super soft and weak. However, I kept doing it and gradually, within a month or two, I was one of the hardest kickers in the gym.<br><br><br><br><br><br>-----<br>Retail Ideas - <br>Retail ideas are a different beast.
